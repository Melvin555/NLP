<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> mikel arteta left is an assistant to manchester city manager pep guardiola rightarsenals priority from the moment wenger announced he would be leaving at the end of the season after nearly 22 years in charge has been to lead a comprehensive recruitment process </s>
<s> wenger came close to departing a year ago and arsenals subsequent travails made it increasingly likely he would go this summer so they are sure to have been surveying the managerial market for some time </s>
<s> in the interim period that market has changed  and so has the makeup of the gunners hierarchy  but they would have had a clear idea of who they wanted to talk with </s>
<s> while it is possible that discreet scouting due diligence and enquiries to establish potential interest and availability may have been conducted while wengers future was undecided out of respect i do not think any significant moves took place behind his back </s>
<s> that meant the club missed the chance to pursue a coach they admire in thomas tuchel </s>
<s> the german viewed arsenal as his perfect destination but could not afford to wait until the wenger situation was resolved and potentially lose the opportunity to join paris stgermain </s>
<s> the problems between tuchel and arsenals head of recruitment sven mislintat from their time together at borussia dortmund were repairable but tuchel accepted psgs offer to replace unai emery to end any idea of him joining the gunners </s>
<s> whether or not the reported interest in germany boss joachim low was genuine it would never have materialised because he was always planning to sign a new contract with the national team </s>
<s> meanwhile and for various reasons the likes of diego simeone of atletico madrid former barcelona manager luis enrique threetime champions league winner carlo ancelotti and celtics brendan rodgers were never seriously considered </s>
<s> there is though said to have been enormous interest in the vacancy and after a long list was reduced to a shortlist juventus coach allegri manchester city assistant arteta and new york city boss patrick vieira emerged as the leading contenders </s>
<s> arteta and vieira were definitely spoken to and  whether directly or indirectly  allegri was too </s>
<s> in this tightly guarded process it is unclear if  and to what extent  there was contact with julian nagelsmann of hoffenheim belgium assistant thierry henry outgoing psg boss emery and monacos leonardo jardim </s>
<s> what we do know is that arsenal have held formal interviews and indepth negotiations </s>
<s> their hope is to make the right decision rather than a quick one </s>
<s> they insist the new man will continue the values instilled by wenger play exciting and progressive football represent arsenal well and integrate young players </s>
<s> arteta is the frontrunner  he wants the job and there is a feeling among staff that he is set to get it  but while it would seem vieira has drifted out of contention whispers persist that allegri remains in the mix </s>

<s> former captain per mertesacker will take over as academy manager this summer joined there by exgunners midfielder freddie ljungberg in a role still to be decided </s>

<s> contrary to popular opinion it is consistently reiterated by the club that american owner stan kroenke is desperate for success and it might not be coincidental that a lot of the changes have come as his son josh  a fellow director  has spent a greater amount of time around arsenal become a more visible presence and exerted increasing influence </s>
<s> in a divergence from the previous regime  wenger retained total power over football matters and built the surrounding structure around himself  arsenal will now adopt a continental model </s>

<s> he pointed out that wenger was hardly a household name when he joined in 1996 adding that doesnt mean we have to make another appointment that not everybody is thinking and talking about but it does mean we need to be bold and get the person we believe is the right person </s>
<s> the implication is that the gunners are not averse to taking a gamble which theoretically is what somebody of artetas minimal experience represents compared to the likes of a proven allegri </s>
<s> gazidis is known to rate arteta extremely highly and you sense the chief executive would have no hesitation about placing him at the helm </s>

<s> brazil thought they had a team to win the world cup and to rival their 1970 side </s>
<s> rossi who was returning from a ban for matchfixing made himself a hero at that tournament and italy went on to win the final beating west germany which by the way was my first world cup final as a commentator </s>

<s> rose is absent through no fault of his own and will miss wentworth as much it misses him </s>
<s> as a junior he was a regular among the west course crowds and it is an event that means more than most to him </s>
<s> but pga tour rules require their members to compete in an event they have not played over the past four years and given the pressures of his global schedule rose had no viable option other than to put this weeks fort worth invitational on his schedule </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> justin rose first played at the pga championship in 2001 when he was just 21 years old but is unable to play this yearfrom the us standpoint it is a sensible regulation </s>
<s> it means players cannot get too set in their ways and sponsors at slightly lesser events have more chance of attracting marquee names </s>
<s> so fort worth gets the olympic champion as well as spains world number four rahm when global logic suggests these players should be thrilling european fans instead </s>
<s> of course it is an inescapable fact that the pga tour calls the shots and other circuits have to bend and adapt accordingly </s>
<s> and this makes monahans views on a potential unified global tour all the more fascinating </s>
<s> the commissioner insists he fully respects the european tour and its chief executive keith pelley </s>
<s> they are partners we work very closely with keith and his team monahan said </s>

<s> so would that prove easier if the tours were to combinepotentially  it depends on how that would come together monahan told me </s>
<s> i certainly think it is something that everybody who is involved in the game should be aspiring to </s>
<s> if you look at whats in the best interests of the fan best interests of the players you could make the case for one global tour </s>
<s> monahan accepts any such move would be extremely complicated and is not imminent but suggested the current climate offered an opportunity </s>
<s> he cites the number of young and established stars in the game and the fact that golf has just returned to the olympics with governments across the world investing in it </s>
<s> theres a lot of opportunity that creates monahan said </s>

<s> that is a possibility absolutely he said </s>

<s> sure </s>
<s>  at face value the vision for a formula 1 style global circuit featuring the worlds best players competing for massive prize funds at courses close to the planets most glamorous cities is hard to resist </s>

<s> i havent heard much but i think it is an inevitability unfortunately englands world number 100 eddie pepperell told the cut bbc golf podcast </s>
<s> i personally dont love the idea of it </s>
<s> i think golfs done a great job over the last couple of decades of making sure 300 guys who play the game at the very top earn a very good living </s>
<s> you cant say that about any other individual sport he added </s>
<s> last year each of the top 80 players on the european tour earned at least 500000 in prize money </s>
<s> its always better to have more people earning more money than less people earning even more and that is what is going to happen if we have a world tour pepperell said </s>
<s> i think the european tour should try as hard as it can to exist on its own two feet </s>
<s> whether it can or not is a different question </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> i have heard a lot of contes interviews this season where there have been little digs here and there about the players who came into the club last year and whether it was with his consent </s>

<s> rose is absent through no fault of his own and will miss wentworth as much it misses him </s>
<s> as a junior he was a regular among the west course crowds and it is an event that means more than most to him </s>
<s> but pga tour rules require their members to compete in an event they have not played over the past four years and given the pressures of his global schedule rose had no viable option other than to put this weeks fort worth invitational on his schedule </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> justin rose first played at the pga championship in 2001 when he was just 21 years old but is unable to play this yearfrom the us standpoint it is a sensible regulation </s>
<s> it means players cannot get too set in their ways and sponsors at slightly lesser events have more chance of attracting marquee names </s>
<s> so fort worth gets the olympic champion as well as spains world number four rahm when global logic suggests these players should be thrilling european fans instead </s>
<s> of course it is an inescapable fact that the pga tour calls the shots and other circuits have to bend and adapt accordingly </s>
<s> and this makes monahans views on a potential unified global tour all the more fascinating </s>
<s> the commissioner insists he fully respects the european tour and its chief executive keith pelley </s>
<s> they are partners we work very closely with keith and his team monahan said </s>
<s> they are also competitors because we are both trying to do the same thing which is create great championships and maximise playing opportunities for our members </s>
<s> so would that prove easier if the tours were to combinepotentially  it depends on how that would come together monahan told me </s>
<s> i certainly think it is something that everybody who is involved in the game should be aspiring to </s>
<s> if you look at whats in the best interests of the fan best interests of the players you could make the case for one global tour </s>
<s> monahan accepts any such move would be extremely complicated and is not imminent but suggested the current climate offered an opportunity </s>
<s> he cites the number of young and established stars in the game and the fact that golf has just returned to the olympics with governments across the world investing in it </s>
<s> theres a lot of opportunity that creates monahan said </s>
<s> and he sees a coming together as a genuine option </s>
<s> that is a possibility absolutely he said </s>
<s> is it going to happen only time will tell but we are not going to avoid that conversation  so answering your question yeah its out there </s>

<s> sure </s>
<s>  at face value the vision for a formula 1 style global circuit featuring the worlds best players competing for massive prize funds at courses close to the planets most glamorous cities is hard to resist </s>

<s> if there is going to be a new manager he can come in and plan  not only for which players are coming in but also who might be leaving  including hazard </s>
<s> so it is a crucial time for chelsea and not an easy one </s>
<s> if they want to keep hazard they will probably need a manager he wants to play for and they will have to attract him  and any potential signings  without the carrot of champions league football </s>
<s> in terms of new players chelsea have to do better than last summer when they did not get their recruitment right </s>
<s> i have heard a lot of contes interviews this season where there have been little digs here and there about the players who came into the club last year and whether it was with his consent </s>
<s> the players picked up on that and that gave them some sort of excuse for not performing as well as they did when they won the title in his first season in charge </s>

<s> but they were much better after the break when they started getting behind the chelsea defence </s>
<s> it was too little too late </s>
<s> romelu lukaku was only fit enough to come on as a substitute with 20 minutes left and in his absence mourinho felt his side lacked a presence in attack </s>
<s> i dont see that as an excuse </s>
<s> they still had plenty of options up front with alexis sanchez and marcus rashford as well as anthony martial on the bench </s>
<s> they still created some great chances too  in particular paul pogbas header when he was unmarked but missed from seven yards out  but i still do not agree with mourinhos claim that the best side lost </s>

<s> they are not getting enough good quality experience of conditions when they are on tour and even though at home they can say we have played three or four rounds of county championship cricket those matches at the extreme ends of the season are not adequate buildup to a test series </s>
<s> the early part of an english summer does not provide a player the opportunity to push his test credentials </s>
<s> at the moment we have all this talk of the hundred </s>
<s> it would be so nice to see english cricket devote that sort of time effort manpower and money into making the championship the best possible breeding ground for test cricket </s>
<s> allied to this is the problem that english conditions do not easily allow england teams to prepare for playing away from home </s>
<s> for example very rarely do you need to play two spinners in england </s>
<s> and so englands dilemma is this they have to improve results but at the same time move the team forward and create a depth in the squad that will serve them well in the winter </s>
<s> ideally england will win at home but win the hard way </s>
<s> we want them to make big totals to bowl teams out in tough conditions to have to battle into the fifth day </s>

<s> that is not a criticism of english conditions </s>
<s> i love to see the ball move around and it is good for visiting teams to come here and be tested </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> scrapping toss would make for boring cricketi cannot believe that people are seriously considering supporting the idea of doing away with the toss in test cricket and giving the choice to the visiting team </s>

<s> im staggered that the international cricket council is giving it a moments consideration and im really disappointed that the england and wales cricket board ecb has decided to support it </s>
<s> i feel really strongly about this </s>
<s> i firmly believe that the excuse being made about pitches being to blame for home teams winning so many test series is a cover for the lack of preparation that visiting teams undertake </s>
<s> if away sides are given proper preparation in the unfamiliar surroundings they would cope far better than if they squeal that pitches are being rigged </s>
<s> in fact pitches are not being rigged </s>
<s> i havent seen a rigged pitch in ages </s>
<s> they werent when england lost in india and they certainly werent in australia </s>
<s> the problem is visiting teams are simply not giving themselves enough time to get used to them </s>
<s> to potentially ruin test cricket by playing it on pitches like roads is not the answer </s>
<s> its a smokescreen to cover the real problems </s>

<s> big summer for big namesit is not only bayliss who is facing an important couple of months </s>

<s> root will be desperate for an improvement in his teams results </s>
<s> its fair to say that this england team have not changed much since he took charge a year ago and now with the ashes behind him perhaps he can start to mould it in his image </s>
<s> i dont think people really understood when i said i would have preferred cook to stay on as captain through the ashes then allow root the chance to bed in over this summer </s>

<s> racing director eric boullier who showed me around the car said the spaniards performance was a mega race </s>
<s> what he did is unbelievable </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> alonso tweeted this photo of his car after the race saying he was proud of his drivehow bad was the damagealonso was caught in a collision with two other cars between turns two and three on the first lap and suffered punctures in both his righthand tyres </s>
<s> by the time he reached turn 15 two corners before the long pit straight it was down to its wheel rims </s>
<s> the 36yearold somehow dragged the car back to the pits but in the process it suffered extensive damage </s>
<s> the aerodynamics of formula 1 cars are extremely sensitive and each flick and curve on the extensively sculpted bodywork is there for a reason  to enhance performance </s>
<s> i was not allowed to take photographs for confidentiality reasons </s>
<s> but the most dramatic damage to alonsos car was to what is called the teatray  the part of the floor that sticks out under the drivers legs and which helps define the airflow under and around the sides of the car </s>
<s> in the front of this there was a triangular hole about 30cm by 20cm as well as significant damage to the leading edge as if someone had set about it with a powerful hammer </s>
<s> some of the heavy tungsten ballast that is stored in the floor was missing </s>
<s> at the back of the car there was damage along the righthand side of the floor all the way from the very back of the diffuser  the upward slope at the rear  to forward of the rear wheel </s>
<s> two sculpted curves on the righthand side of the rear diffuser were gone </s>
<s> in front of the rear tyre two key aerodynamic shapers were missing too  what mclaren call a fence a longitudinal curve and a spat a sort of vertical rectangular scoopshape </s>
<s> all in all boullier said the damage cost 20 points of downforce more or less  so half a second a lap </s>
<s> despite this after changing tyres and front wing alonso returned to the race and lapped faster than teammate stoffel vandoorne on all but a handful of laps </s>
<s> how did he get it back to the pitseven getting the car back to the pits in the first place was something of an achievement boullier said </s>
<s> the front tyre deflated straight away after turn three and then it takes some time before you lose the tyre from the rim boullier said </s>
<s> the rear right tyre deflated i think around turn 15 </s>
<s> you can see from the television footage that after entering the pit lane the car is not driveable and actually he hit the wall on the righthand side </s>
<s> at that stage he told us after he did not know how to bring the car to the pit </s>
<s> he didnt know if the car would steer </s>
<s> he just tried to go straight on the fast lane and he thought he would leave it there and we would take it out of the race </s>
<s> at the last minute he turned and the car steered into the pitstop bay </s>
<s> we made a joke with him and said it was the best positioning of the weekend </s>
<s> he said lets change the tyres and front wing and go </s>
<s>  from the pit wall i saw these flames all around the floor </s>
<s> the car was on fire </s>
<s> mclaren could not see all the damage because the front floor is hidden by the aerodynamic shapers behind the tyres </s>
<s> so after checking the car was structurally sound and safe they sent alonso back out with new tyres and front wing </s>
<s> he spent a couple of laps asking what they could see from the data and whether they needed him to change any settings </s>
<s> it turned out that while it had lost downforce and was theoretically slower it felt ok to drive </s>
<s> actually the car was still more or less balanced strangely boullier says </s>
<s> the reason was there was this big hole in the front floor so we lost downforce at the front and rear </s>
<s> so the car was not very well balanced but it was still driveable </s>
<s> he didnt complain about anything not even driveability </s>
<s> how did alonsos performance compare with vandoornes the belgian was struggling with his tyres more than usual boullier says but alonso finished two places ahead and his average lap time was 0 </s>
<s> 521 seconds quicker in a car theoretically 0 </s>
<s> 5 seconds slower </s>

<s> debris spills across the track as alonso continues to drive his damaged carhow did alonso do itthis is not the first time alonso has overachieved in a damaged car </s>
<s> in qualifying at the 2006 italian grand prix a rear tyre failure left his renault with broken rear bodywork but he went on to set the fifth fastest time  and faster than teammate giancarlo fisichella in a healthy car </s>
<s> renaults sporting director alan permane then a race engineer at the team said of that performance half the car was ripped off </s>
<s> we measured the downforce hed lost calculated what that should have translated to in lap time and he lost nowhere near that </s>
<s> its like he sort of refuses to accept it </s>
<s> now boullier says he has this facility to switch his driving style always to suit the car balance </s>
<s> he is one of the very rare ones </s>
<s> depending on the balance whether you have front brake locking rear locking straight away he adjusts his driving to not hurt the tyres </s>
<s> in that case it helped him a lot </s>
<s> i compare him sometimes to a shark when it smells blood in the sea </s>
<s> then it starts to chase </s>
<s> fernando is the same </s>
<s> in that mode he decided change the tyres lets go back racing just check the balance and tell me what i need to do if i need to change something </s>
<s> all weekend actually he was telling us nothing is important other than finishing the race </s>
<s> it is going to be chaos </s>
<s> we need to go through the chaos and finish the race and we will be in the points </s>
<s> i think thats why he came back saying change the tyres change the front wing dont worry i am going to drive it like it is </s>
<s> boullier believes that alonsos mindset in these early races has been affected by the teams difficult start to the season with a car far off the pace they were expecting </s>
<s> after justifying their decision last year to split with engine partner honda on the basis that they had one of the best chassis on the grid mclaren have joined forces with renault only to find they are around a second lap slower than red bull who use the same engine </s>
<s> alonso has qualified 11th once and 13th three times in the first four races </s>
<s> mclarens lack of pace has led to chief technical officer tim goss being removed from his post </s>
<s> yet in the races alonso has taken three sevenths and a fifth and he is sixth in the drivers championship </s>
<s> largely thanks to him mclaren are fourth in the constructors championship </s>
<s> this boullier believes has influenced the team as well </s>
<s> after all they could have decided to retire the car in baku given the extent of the damage </s>
<s> maybe we got conditioned as well by him all weekend saying we need to finish the race this is the key boullier says </s>
<s> we also are in a different place </s>
<s> qualifying pace is not our best and so we have shifted our mindset to we need to grab any points we can </s>
<s>  and that means by any means we need to finish the race </s>
<s> this is our mindset since australia </s>
<s> we want to capitalise on the first four races and grab as many points as possible </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> his future has become one of the key topics of conversation this year </s>
<s> the fight in baku was for fourth and fifth places </s>
<s> neither was going to finish higher than that unless someone else dropped out or there was contact </s>
<s> and there was no gain for the team whichever driver emerged ahead </s>
<s> from that point of view it was a relatively futile battle for just two points </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ricciardo turns the wheel left after initially going right committing to the inside for the slight gap he sees on verstappens insidethe way ricciardo and verstappen went at it was risky astonishing and initially brilliant to watch </s>
<s> the tone was set by verstappens aggression early on </s>
<s> his overtaking move on ricciardo into turn two at the safetycar restart on lap six laid down a marker </s>
<s> the problem was he then did not have ricciardos pace and held him up for the next 35 laps </s>
<s> many drivers in verstappens shoes would have taken a more cautious approach especially as he had had incidents in every race so far in 2018 was a lowly eighth in the standings and needed to start bringing home some strong results </s>
<s> but verstappen was as aggressive as ive seen him for a long time </s>
<s> every time ricciardo tried to pass on the outside verstappen would fly in from the inside late on the brakes his wheels locked up fighting to the death to hold onto that fourth position </s>
<s> at one point this even led to contact on the exit of turn one where the incoming barrier on the outside makes the track jink in on the exit </s>
<s> they were lucky to emerge from that unscathed </s>
<s> verstappens aggression came from the fact he is naturally a tough racer </s>
<s> he has always been fierce in wheeltowheel combat  not always getting it right but always getting stuck in and not being afraid to trade a bit of paint with his rivals </s>
<s> what added an extra edge to this was the previous race in china </s>
<s> there verstappen had the race to lose he was ahead of his teammate on track after red bull made their decisive decision to change tyres behind the safety car </s>
<s> but a big error and a collision dropped him well out of contention and he was left to watch as ricciardo swept to a brilliant victory </s>
<s> to see your teammate do that well is painful as a driver especially when you know it could have been you in their shoes and that its your own fault that it was not </s>
<s> after china everyone was waxing lyrical about ricciardos moves and questioning verstappens wheeltowheel skills </s>
<s> baku was a chance for verstappen to prove on track that he is every bit a match for his teammate and his aggression showed just how much doing that meant </s>
<s> who was to blame </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ricciardos dummy worked to move verstappen slightly but at 350kmh he is aiming for a tiny gap leaving zero margin for error or reaction from either driverit was absolutely brilliant to see the dicing between the two </s>
<s> but every time they got close into turn one i was wincing waiting for contact </s>
<s> such was the two drivers determination and willingness to risk that the longer it went on the more it seemed inevitable they would crash </s>
<s> ricciardo looked to have made the decisive move when he finally overtook verstappen on lap 35 around the outside into turn one </s>
<s> it was a brilliant pass ricciardo at his very best superdeep on the brakes giving verstappen no chance to come back </s>
<s> ricciardo probably thought he had finally cracked his teammate </s>
<s> so when verstappen reappeared ahead after their pit stops shortly afterwards it would have been galling for ricciardo </s>
<s> stopping one lap earlier should have given ricciardo the advantage but the slow warmup of his tyres meant he lost track position and had to do it all again </s>
<s> in my opinion verstappen was brave and maybe slightly foolish to be racing ricciardo so hard for the first 40 laps </s>
<s> equally though i believe ricciardo was the braver and potentially more culpable when they collided to end their races </s>
<s> its easy to blame verstappen because of his history  years of aggressive overthetop defending plus his difficult start to 2018 compared to ricciardos clean driving history and brilliant overtaking </s>
<s> but if people step back and analyse this incident in isolation it is much more 5050 </s>
<s> ricciardo tried to sell verstappen a dummy </s>
<s> to an extent it worked but then he fully committed his car to the inside to the smallest of gaps with a huge closing speed from which he could not bail out </s>
<s> this is at the end of a twokilometre straight and is the highest speed on the entire calendar </s>
<s> to be fighting for such a small gap at 350kmh 217mph is a huge risk that did not need to be taken </s>
<s> initially there was a slight gap there but when verstappen instinctively moved back to the left to shut it off contact was inevitable </s>
<s> technically this was two moves to defend from verstappen </s>
<s> and that is against the rules which say a driver cannot move more than once to defend his position </s>
<s> moving in the braking area to defend is a big nono in f1 because by that time its too late and the driver behind cannot do anything to avoid contact </s>
<s> in this case the movement from verstappen was a bit earlier than that and it was a tiny move to shut off a tiny gap that had opened on the inside </s>
<s> the moves were a matter of inches rather than sweeping across the width of the track which is more what the rules are aimed at preventing </s>
<s> verstappens driving was questionable but ricciardo was too committed and i think too ambitious the absolute definition of a doordie </s>
<s> and this time he got it slightly wrong </s>
<s> in ricciardos mitigation it is easy to see that his teammates overt aggression throughout the race might have wound him up a bit too much and he got suckered into the move </s>
<s> all in all i think the stewards were right to call it a racing incident </s>
<s> ultimately both were to blame </s>
<s> it was ambitious from ricciardo defending in a grey area on the limit from verstappen </s>
<s> but when these two were fighting like that for 40 laps i dont think many were surprised by the outcome in the end </s>

<s> red bull have told ricciardo and verstappen their crash was unacceptablewhere do red bull go from hereit begs the question what red bull will do now will they impose team orders or will they continue to let their drivers fight </s>
<s> red bull has become a popular team in this generation especially with the arrival of verstappen </s>
<s> they have two hugely talented drivers maybe both future world champions fighting it out tooth and nail in a car that is still a fraction behind the top two teams </s>
<s> they often need a cavalier attitude to win races and they have it at the heart of their racing </s>

<s> no other frontrunners did it </s>
<s> red bull instil a sense of fun </s>
<s> their attitude is feisty give anything a go </s>
<s> it comes from the top down in that team and we love it </s>
<s> probably every other team on the grid would have imposed team orders before the contact between their drivers in baku such was the intensity and duration of their battle </s>
<s> it is easy to admire red bull for not doing that </s>
<s> they put a lot of trust and faith in their drivers to fight it out cleanly between them </s>
<s> but this time it came back to bite and the trust might not be there anymore </s>

<s> it was a humbling end to a brilliant scrap but these two are young and will bounce back </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> bottas left came off second best to vettel rightive been in situations like bottas was in </s>

<s> you relive the moment  in bottas case the first corner of the last lap  and think what if id have dived down the insideon balance the finn had a great weekend in bahrain </s>
<s> he outpaced teammate lewis hamilton in qualifying which is no mean feat and did a strong race to hunt down vettel managing his pace and tyres well throughout </s>
<s> bottas is an extremely good driver as i also mentioned in my column after the australian grand prix </s>
<s> but i wonder if he lacks a killer instinct in wheeltowheel racecraft </s>
<s> if vettel had been defending from hamilton on the last lap  and certainly if he had been defending against either of the two red bulls  im sure he would have faced some sort of attack down the inside </s>
<s> daniel ricciardo has shown time and again that he is willing to lunge up the inside of anybody none more notable than against bottas in the us grand prix last year </s>
<s> in that race ricciardo threw the car down the inside from an unfathomable distance </s>
<s> at the first attempt the australian ran off the track and bottas repassed but next time ricciardo made it stick </s>
<s> bottas had the chance to do the same to vettel in bahrain </s>
<s> in short bottas isnt good enough for mercedeswhy bottas should have gone for itim not a fan of big runoff areas on these modern circuits but one of the benefits is if you go into a corner too hot you can just run wide and return to the track </s>
<s> in many cases this is frustrating to watch as a fan and the drivers also prefer the challenge of having gravel or barriers closer where mistakes get punished </s>
<s> but if bottas had committed down the inside he either would have emerged from turn one with the lead and the win or he would have gone in too deep and ended up having vettel slide back underneath him and ultimately finished second </s>
<s> at least that way he would know he had given it a go </s>
<s> the only way such a move would end in tears is if he was halfhearted and stuck just a nose down the inside </s>
<s> thats where collisions so often happen </s>
<s> note how few times ricciardo actually makes contact with another driver despite his amazing overtaking bravado </s>
<s> he commits so heavily to his moves that they either come off or he overshoots the corner too much and loses the place again </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> drivers earn reputations in f1 in wheeltowheel racing </s>
<s> as a driver you take into account who it is you are fighting with before deciding to defend attack chop or lunge </s>
<s> for example i always knew if i was fighting someone like kevin magnussen he would be an extremely tough opponent and not give an inch even when we were teammatesmagnussen had another fantastic weekend finishing in a welldeserved fifth place but yet again got stuck in having contact with renaults nico hulkenberg on lap one before more with toro rossos pierre gasly on the restart after the virtual safety car </s>
<s> he was perhaps slightly lucky to get away with both of those with a car still intact but these moments cement his reputation as a feisty racer and people are a bit more cautious about passing him as a result </s>
<s> fernando alonso of course is another example of a driver you know will never cede a position without giving 110 to hang on to it if at all possible </s>
<s> and if you see a red bull in your mirrors you know they will have a lunge as soon as possible because of the nature of their two aggressive drivers </s>
<s> that means you sometimes defend unnecessarily and end up getting distracted looking too much in your mirrors handing the advantage straight to them </s>
<s> i feel bottas has the reverse effect in f1 at the moment </s>
<s> yes hes had a few scrapes most notably with countryman kimi raikkonen but hes seen as something of a soft touch in wheeltowheel fighting </s>
<s> drivers are throwing moves down the inside of him that they wouldnt try on hamilton in the other mercedes for example because they know bottas would rather let them through than risk a crash </s>
<s> of course this is true to some extent with most drivers in championship contention but the others simply drive a bit closer to that risk </s>
<s> bottas nonattempt at a move on the final lap may have been borne out of a natural caution and a willingness to finish second which many others around him wouldnt have </s>
<s> he made matters worse by being caught in two minds and ending up in the middle of the road into turn one making his exit harder and letting vettel off the hook at turn four as well the next best overtaking place on the circuit </s>
<s> bottas is an incredibly talented driver but if he is to really take the fight to those around him i feel he needs a bit more bite in the heat of battle </s>
<s> his bahrain weekend shows he has the pace to win races and fight with the best </s>
<s> he now has a strong haul of 18 points after two races and that keeps him within reach of the championship protagonists </s>
<s> but perhaps it could have been seven more from bahrain and more from melbourne as well if he had made more progress from 15th on the grid </s>
<s> considering hamiltons ability to hustle vettel in australia its conceivable bottas could perhaps have done more </s>
<s> having said that its early stages in the season and at least the pace bottas showed and his charge at the end will give him confidence heading to china this weekend </s>
<s> vettel at his best </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hamilton and vettel have won seven out of the last eight championships between themif vettels victory in melbourne two weeks ago was somewhat fortuitous bahrain was a heroic drive </s>
<s> pole to win seems so easy on the face of it but in reality this was far from it </s>
<s> after struggling throughout practice and qualifying mercedes were more than a match for ferrari on race pace and once bottas jumped raikkonen off the line we were all set up for another mercedes v ferrari showdown </s>
<s> although vettel led the first stint mercedes put ferrari on the back foot by switching to a onestop strategy with both cars forcing the german to eke out his soft tyres for 39 long laps </s>
<s> what followed was an absolute masterclass in race management and composure </s>
<s> vettel declared after the race that the tyres were finished and this was evident from the time sheets </s>
<s> as bottas closed in at the end it seemed inevitable he would take the win on the fresher tyres but vettel used all of his cunning to keep the last bit of life in his tyres and maintain just enough distance to the man behind </s>
<s> there is no more desperate feeling for a driver than being chased down like this in the final laps </s>
<s> you are in a strong position doing the absolute most you can with what you have and someone is hunting you and making massive inroads into your advantage </s>
<s> when vettel was told bottas pace towards the end of the race was over a second a lap quicker than his he said he did the maths and it didnt look good thats an understatement to say the least </s>
<s> its a horrible feeling </s>
<s> but he kept his head down focused on his job and did it perfectly </s>

<s> to do that and come out with my first major it was a risk </s>
<s> but it was a risk that was the right one </s>
<s> it is a refreshing approach a break from the commercial normality of the professional game </s>
<s> for fans it is surely more authentic to know a player is using a certain club or ball because they like it rather than for vast financial gain </s>
<s> the elite players receive millions to play exclusively with the clubs and balls of a certain manufacturer and to then tell us they are competing with the best equipment they have ever used </s>

<s> listen the cut podcast  masters 2018 reviewat every level commercial interests permeate the paid ranks </s>

<s> how do you spot a pro golfer in the street chances are an incongruously pale forehead provides the giveaway clue </s>

<s> i know from my time working with ed in the test match special commentary box that he is a man who likes flair players  he is a big fan of tennis player roger federer for example </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> buttler certainly fits into that category </s>
<s> smith described him as one of the outstanding talents in world cricket and buttlers inclusion in a 12man squad for the first test against pakistan starting next thursday is a hugely positive move </s>

<s> anyone who has seen some of buttlers innings in oneday cricket  he is responsible for three of the five quickest england hundreds in history  will testify to how dangerous he can be </s>
<s> there have always been doubts over whether he can translate that form into the test arena and this recall means he has got to knuckle down and show he has the technique and temperament for the longer form of the game </s>

<s> vince has had plenty of chances and has looked the part at times but he has simply not scored the runs  three fifties in 13 tests and an average of less than 25 say as much </s>
<s> at number three you have got to have a dependable technique and we have not seen that from him </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> stoneman can consider himself very fortunate to keep his place given that he has a highest score of 29 in seven county championship innings this season </s>
<s> he is the one concern from my point of view </s>
<s> he must get runs  and he must get them soon </s>

<s> it appears england are already planning for those trips </s>
<s> given that bess has taken only one wicket this summer the selectors have clearly seen something in his attitude on the county circuit and with the lions </s>
<s> i know he is a strong character </s>
<s> there was much talk when smith was appointed that england selection would become much more heavily influenced by statistics </s>
<s> however judging by my time in the commentary box with ed he is not a man obsessed by data </s>

<s> saracens are almost at their best defending waiting to pounce on the smallest of mistakes </s>
<s> but equally theyre now more potent with the ball from anywhere on the field </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> theyve gone from being a side that was very defensive three or four seasons ago to a side that has opened up their offence </s>

<s> box office back rows come facetoface </s>
<s> billy vunipola against sam simmonds in the meeting of the two number eights should really show us why billy is the number one choice in an england shirt for that position </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> simmonds is a brilliant club player </s>
<s> as brief as hes been a regular for chiefs hes had a great impact </s>
<s> hes like an openside flanker playing at number eight </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> hes not stepped immediately into that international position </s>
<s> theres more power required there </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if you dont have that power at six and seven which he has at exeter it allows him as a smaller quicker man to be able to play at eight </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> with don armand and dave ewers alongside in the chiefs back row they can do the donkeywork some big carrying allowing simmonds to play on the edge </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not that he cant work in congestion hes better in space </s>
<s> in tight situations he can use his quick feet </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its one of those weird anomalies where hes so good at club level but at the moment average internationally </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but hes new and i critique him harshly because of what hes up against internationally </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when you look at the likes of billy vunipola they step into the england team and it seems like another game in another shirt where they have the same presence and now with added experience  theyre world class </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> simmonds has the same impact in a club game so hes going to be an influential figure on the final for sure </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> can we learn anything from the last two playoff encounters </s>
<s> their previous meetings in the past two seasons playoff games victory for saracens in the 2016 final a win for exeter in the 2017 semifinal just gives this final more experience </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> for me the experience of the big time is with saracens </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> exeter have arrived at the big time and with victory on saturday they rubberstamped that entry into the big time </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> saracens are already in the big time and for four or five seasons theyve always been challenging for silverware </s>
<s> exeter have done it on a domestic level for the past three seasons </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> exeter beat saracens in the 2017 premiership semifinal </s>
<s> a lastditch sam simmonds try gave exeter victory against saracens in last seasons premiership semifinal </s>
<s> with the big match temperament and experience on saracens side they will be favourites in many peoples eyes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it will be an explosive game because some of these guys are going on tour together the following week </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> exeter flanker don armand isnt going to south africa and will be hoping to show eddie jones hes made a mistake </s>
<s> simmonds will want to show that he can live against these big back rows </s>

<s> winger olly woodburn has had a tremendous season yet again with a number of tries </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> theyre like the domestic equivalent of new zealand on their day </s>
<s> as good as exeter can play right now their best is not as good as saracens </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> bob davies would have been forgiven for rolling up at aintree on 1 april 1978 thinking he did not have much chance of winning the grand national </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> lucius was only the shropshire jockeys fourth ride in the race  and he had previously only got round the 30 fences once on national day </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> he had originally been booked to ride at towcester that day </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> he had never sat on his horse in a race having only inherited the spare ride when luciuss regular pilot dave goulding was injured in a fall at wetherby five days before the race </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and perhaps most dishearteningly of all he was to be up against red rum </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a year earlier when the great rummy won for the third and final time davies on duffle coat had fallen at the first fence  one of seven fallers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but fate was to have a fortuitous twist or two for davies </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the legendary red rum by then almost 13 years of age was withdrawn on the morning of the race having suffered a hairline fracture the day before </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it was no april fools joke </s>
<s> suddenly the field was reduced by one </s>
<s> and for davies it turned into a triumph that is still billed to this day as one of the best spare rides in history </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> following his famous third and last grand national win a year earlier red rum was entered again in 1978 but withdrew on the morning of the race </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i was a bit lucky he told bbc sport </s>
<s> but only in the way i got the ride </s>
<s> make no mistake about it lucius was a very good winner </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> dave goulding should have ridden him for gordon richards as he was his jockey but he hurt his back at wetherby on the monday </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i was at wetherby on the tuesday and one of the other jockeys ron barry said to me do you have a spare ride in the national </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i told him i was actually due to go to towcester that day but he said well lucius is going spare </s>
<s> ill have a word with gordon </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i went back that night to look at his form which showed he was best over two and a half miles but that he had also won over three and didnt like being in front </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i had a vision and a passion for democratising equestrianism for growing it for modernising it and also for putting it on a firm financial footing </s>

<s> equestrian sport is like a private club </s>
<s> salmon was appointed chief executive in 2016 having previously worked as a director at insurance company royal london </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the report states that while some within the sport viewed that as a positive move that was aiming to bring equestrianism to a wide audience and to engage with more peripheral areas of the sport and a refreshing change to a snobbish old boys club of a military culture others viewed her as an outsider </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> theres a small cabal of people within the leadership of the olympic disciplines and the report draws attention to this for whom equestrian sport is almost like a private club salmon said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the review draws attention for example within british dressage to a small elite team basically a cabal of people who control the sport and it also draws attention to the fact that the sport is prohibitively expensive for the majority of people who might be interested in taking part </s>
<s> and thats what i mean by elitism </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so there were people for whom opening up horse sport to a wider audience was actually anathema because they would rather break up the party </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> salmon also warned that funding for equestrian sports already reduced since the rio games should be further reassessed if the recommendations of the report are not implemented </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i think when public money is at stake and in this case theres about 20m of national lottery funding at stake there is a higher standard there is a duty of care to spend that money properly she said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in terms of showjumping dressage and eventing i think its key that there is a dramatic improvement in the leadership of those organizations if uk sport is to continue supporting them </s>
<s> public money needs to follow public standards of behaviour </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> that warning was echoed by the report itself which stated funding is conditional on appropriate governance and cultural behaviours </s>
<s> in that regard uk sport and sport england are encouraged to remind all mbs that if they try to usurp the authority of the bef then their funding may be suspended </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> certain behaviours which manifested themselves at times during the relevant period were not appropriate for a publiclyfunded sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> what do the funding bodies say </s>
<s> in a joint statement uk sport and sport england said they welcome the review and recommendations </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> all sports  and especially those in receipt of public funding  must demonstrate that they are run to the highest standards of governance led by skilled and diverse boards </s>
<s> sports that are unable to demonstrate these standards will not receive funding in the future it read </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the review is clear that these standards and behaviours have not been met in the past across equestrian sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> while we recognise that structural and leadership changes have recently been made ongoing funding will be dependent on the bef and its member bodies acting to implement the recommendations of this review </s>

<s> there have of course been incidents in the past but not on this kind of scale with this kind of widespread publicity  the number looking at the frightening images of the ascot fight online is well into seven figures </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its as much the talk of the racing community as wholl win next months derby at the moment especially as the two tracks concerned are ascot and goodwood both of which trade on their upmarket reputations </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> the word that is used most frequently when discussing this is cocaine </s>
<s> people are talking not so much about drink and other things causing this type of problem but drugs being the number one factor </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> one of the priorities for racecourses this summer  and this is happening  is to bring in sniffer dogs to catch people with drugs i was struck during a visit to the gents at a recent fixture that there was a queue for the privacy of cubicles when urinals were free a telltale sign im told </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> with royal ascot and glorious goodwood not far off and events like the derby on the horizon racing officials must have this at the very top of the agenda to stamp it out quickly before the sport gets a reputation as the goto place for this type of activity putting off the lawabiding majority </s>

<s> quite a journey already for the pe teacher who only started officiating for fun </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when i started it wasnt because i specifically wanted to be a referee i did it for fun she told bbc sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and then i noticed that most of the referees were men and that female presence was ignored </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> at the beginning there were few international female referees but they hadnt really made a mark in tunisian stadiums in mens matches </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> women were limited to womens matches or youth games </s>
<s> why does it have to stop there so i decided to try other categories </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ganouati is one of three tunisian women on fifas list of international referees and has been on it since 2015 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the only other woman to have been a fourth official in tunisias ligue 1 was monia bedoui back in 1997 season for a match between cs sfaxienand club olympique du transport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> she is well aware of the pressure involved in making the step up from ligue 2 when she worked with an allfemale team of officials </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> theres more pressure because theres a bigger number of fans in the first division </s>
<s> especially with the big teams who have a bigger fan following she said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the main source of pressure will be from the fans then on the pitch it comes from officials or players </s>

<s> monia bedoui left and dorsaf ganouati are the only two women to have been fourth officials in tunisias ligue 1 </s>
<s> fear is present in every game </s>
<s> even when im refereeing in international games outside the country there are some concerns </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> youre responsible for the teams and you have to be just and fair to everyone </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i have my reputation as a referee and people are always watching closely and any mistake can cost dearly </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but all that fear goes away once the first whistle blows and you get involved in the game </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ganouati admits in the early days it was not easy to make progress in a sport dominated by men </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the main obstacle we have is that we dont have the concept of females being part of professional football matches </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when i was working in the regional league they were a bit unwelcoming to women they would often say a woman in the regional league no </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the challenges she faced simply spurred her on and the attitude towards her and other female referees is improving </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> quite the opposite i insist on taking part now and must carry on she explained </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it has gotten better </s>
<s> i have refereed many teams in the regional leagues with fewer issues and things are improving when i referee in 3rd and 2nd division games </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> she also feels like an equal among her male colleagues and has earned their respect </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> as far as my colleagues go were familiar with each other were all equal she insisted </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> dorsaf ganouati during the tunisian ligue 1 match between ca bizertin and as gabes </s>
<s> theres no difference between male and female referees </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they might actually be more respectful since im a woman but i also impose my selfrespect </s>
<s> the same thing goes for players im in charge of keeping everything in order </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> while ganouati was pleased to get a chance to be part of an officiating team at the highest level she was less happy that it only happened on the last day of the season </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i dont like the idea of bringing in a female referee solely at the end as a way of polishing the season she argued </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i will try and get given games right from the beginning of next season at least in the 2nd division that way even if im assigned at the end of the season to a topflight game it wont really be a big problem </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> she also has a philosophical approach to the violence that was a regular problem at tunisian stadiums last season </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i dont feel a threat per se </s>
<s> i feel sorry when i see what happens since this is not a beautiful image of tunisia especially as our league is viewed practically everywhere she pointed out </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but im just like every other referee i know when i go to the stadium there could be a positive or a negative outcome im prepared </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> before kickoff i remember our manager joe fagan saying to us dont forget this lot are at home </s>

<s> that was where joe and the rest of the anfield bootroom boys  as the reds coaching staff was known  were very clever </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we did not call it psychology in those days it was plain manmanagement and it was about getting the best out of the players in the really big games to make sure we performed in them like we had done during the rest of the season </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> klopp will be trying to do the same ahead of this weekend </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> he will be saying to his players that if they treat it like just another game and they play anything like they know they can do then they have got a really good chance </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the best way of doing that from a players point of view is to really try to forget about the buildup the crowd and the millions watching on tv and play the game not the occasion or the opposition </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is difficult but what i would do is kind of transport myself to the old park pitch i played on in preston as a kid where the rules are the same and the pitch is the same size  admittedly it might not be the same condition though </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> if i am right and they do win it for a sixth time then it would be a huge achievement </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> in that scenario then in some ways what happens next does not matter because you can just look at winning the champions league in isolation </s>
<s> it is that big </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> he added youve got to push through the wall </s>
<s> when you get tired you cant slow down you have to fight all the way to the end </s>
<s> and thats what callum was doing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i never felt too bad i was tired it was hot but it always felt manageable on the right side of what was safe </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> theres a lot to take in at the commonwealth games </s>
<s> some of it can be a bit confusing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> here are some of the weirdest faqs cleared right up for you </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> is there actually an age limit on competitors </s>
<s> wales 11yearold table tennis player anna hursey is one of the commonwealth games youngest ever competitors </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> shes also the youngest player ever to represent wales at a senior level in any sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> undefined thumbnail </s>
<s> 1 min </s>
<s> hursey beat ugandas halima nambozo 40 in her opening group match but lost 40 to malaysias li sian alice chang  ranked 126 places above her  in her second group game to miss out on a place in the last 32 of the womens singles </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> at the other end of the spectrum theres canadas 79yearold full bore shooter robert pitcairn  the oldest ever competitor at the games </s>
<s> he also once foiled a hijacker on a flight so theres that </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so could you technically enter the games as say a 90yearold sprinter or a fiveyearold cyclist </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> each sport has an international federation and that body sets age limits in their sport chris jenkins from commonwealth games wales told bbc three </s>
<s> for example mountain biking is 21 but track cycling is lower </s>
<s> table tennis does not have an age limit while gymnastics has an age limit of 16 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> both the olympics and commonwealth games leave decisions on age limits to the individual sports bodies who are best able to assess risks and suitability </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> why do they give out green cards in hockey </s>
<s> green card hockeygettyimages </s>
<s> havent watched any hockey since the olympics confused as to why the ref keeps showing those green cards </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a green card is a warning and can entail a temporary suspension for two minutes of playing time </s>
<s> a yellow card can result in the offending player being temporarily suspended for a minimum of five minutes while the red card is for more serious offences </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> well there you know now </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> dont they have to wear protective head gear in the boxing events </s>
<s> these vou siutu of australia and frazer clarke of england compete during the mens 91kg quarterfinal boxinggettyimages </s>
<s> nope </s>
<s> the 2014 commonwealth games were the first time since 1982 that male boxers competed without head guards </s>
<s> the reasoning came from research showing there had actually been an increase in the number of head injuries since head gear was introduced to amateur boxing prior to the 1984 los angeles olympic games </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when you have a head guard on you are more likely to get an injury explains dr mike loosemore lead consultant in sport and exercise medicine at the institute of sport exercise  health </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there are several reasons for this it could be that head guards restrict your vision slightly so you dont see the punches coming and maybe that the head guard increases the size of the head </s>
<s> but the most likely reason is people just feel more confident with a head guard on </s>
<s> they dont put their head in a position where it cant get hit </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 4 </s>
<s> why do i feel myself suddenly drawn to lawn bowls </s>
<s> andrew newell lawn bowlsgettyimages </s>
<s> this ones easy the reggae rollers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> south londoner andrew newell 44 was inspired by film cool runnings to set up the lawn bowls association and is representing jamaica through his parents heritage for the countrys debut at the commonwealth games </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> his idea was to get more coverage for the sport and encourage participation from younger and more diverse communities </s>

<s> this is an increase of 45 athletes and 73 medals from the 2014 glasgow games </s>

<s> 6 </s>
<s> which country has the most interesting flag </s>
<s> mozambique flag bearergettyimages </s>
<s> probably mozambique whose flag includes an image of an ak47 with bayonet attached </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i wouldnt say i got away with it when i was rowing </s>
<s> when i did the boat race even at weighin day i was 86kg 13st 7lbs i think added simmonds who has a phd in organic chemistry </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> simmonds cries at the finish </s>
<s> simmonds was incredibly emotional as she discovered she had claimed the bronze medal </s>
<s> with a mantra of lose an ounce gain a second she eventually won the british national time trial championships in 2015 the same year in which she clocked 19 minutes and 46 seconds for the distance </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> threehour morning rides or sessions on the turbo trainer twice a day have melted away mass from her 5ft 5in frame </s>
<s> to stand next to simmonds now you wonder how she actually carried the extra weight </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> anyone can do it </s>
<s> it doesnt matter if your goal is a 30minute time trial just little regular goals </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> making the commonwealth podium is hardly a little goal </s>
<s> simmonds admitted the sense of achievement felt incredible but she is already looking to make the british team at the 2020 olympic games </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there is now no more weight to really lose but given the focus which has brought her this far reaching the sporting carnival in tokyo two years from now would be another turn in simmonds transformation </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> more than 90 of athletes and staff said they were proud to be part of their programmes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> yet there were concerns over giving feedback and mental health support </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> almost a third of athletes 31 disagreed they had opportunities to give feedback without fear of negative consequences in their worldclass programme </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> one in six athletes said they had experienced unacceptable behaviour with a similar number saying they had witnessed it but only 24 reported it to their national governing body </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nearly a quarter 24 said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the measures taken in their sport to optimise the mental health of highperformance athletes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> all sports were invited to take part in the review with 682 athletes responding out of 895 asked </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> uk sport said the results are largely encouraging but acknowledged some clear areas for improvement with a need to enhance feedback address unacceptable behaviour and understand more about mental health </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the findings prove that the majority of the highperformance system is working brilliantly well is valued by the athletes and staff and is enabling them to achieve amazing things in very challenging circumstances uk sport chief executive liz nicholl told bbc sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but every issue raised in a report like this is very serious and every sport will develop an action plan to address its specific issues </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> several british sporting governing bodies have been embroiled in controversy around duty of care standards including cycling gymnastics taekwondo paraswimming and parasnowsport </s>

<s> in response to thursdays report uk sport announced a new range of initiatives aimed at improving athlete welfare </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the agency will double its funding of the independent british athletes commission bac to 1m before the 2020 tokyo olympics and paralympics </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there should be routes for athletes to voice their concerns and be heard ideally within the sport so that concerns can be dealt with early doors added nicholl </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but failing that an athlete needs an effective and supportive bac that they can turn to for independent support and help </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> uk sport says its increased funding for the bac will allow the organisation to have a casework officer in the north and south of the country and provide continuous support rather than just responding to incidents </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a series of roadshows are also being staged around the country linking up current and former athletes with careers advice and workshops </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the report also found there have been improvements in whistleblowing and reporting procedures plus more support around mental and physical health issues </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> ian braid the managing director of the independent advisory organisation duty of care in action sport dociasport and former head of the bac said he was pleased about the funding increase </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however the key recommendation in baroness greythompsons duty of care review for the government which stated that the bac should be independentlyfunded has been ignored </s>

<s> this is a shame as that would have given athletes more confidence in the system and that genuine grievances would be properly investigated and disclosed </s>

<s> bbc sports editor dan roan </s>
<s> this could serve as a wakeup call for british sport </s>
<s> the survey paints a mixed picture of the olympic and paralympic landscape </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> on the one hand nine out of 10 respondents answered positively about the quality of support they receive and the pride they feel representing their country </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but after a spate of bullying scandals in a variety of publicly funded sports over the past year it is also alarming to learn that so many athletes have experienced unacceptable behaviour and clearly fear being deselected if they speak out about it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> uk sport says the fact they were prepared to conduct such a study proves they are addressing the problem and the additional funding for the british athletes commission will be welcomed by many </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but some critics would have liked to see the establishment of an independent sport ombudsman to rule on disputes and greater rights for athletes in the contracts they have to sign in return for funding </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> meanwhile debate will continue over whether british sport is any different from other walks of life when it comes to duty of care or if the nocompromise approach to the pursuit of medals is to blame for failings </s>

<s> here is our threepoint argument for why cheerleading should be seriously considered for the olympic roster come los angeles 2028 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 1 </s>
<s> its that sport you never knew you loved </s>
<s> we all become obsessed with watching new obscure sports during the olympics </s>
<s> curling fencing dancing horses </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> theres always at least one </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> not only is cheerleading exciting noisy and slightly terrifying to watch live in the arena it is also utterly captivating to watch on the small screen </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> team england had the chance to showoff their skills at disneys allstar sports field  an iconic venue in the world of cheerleading </s>
<s> slowmotion replays of gravitydefying stunts yes please </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> watching some of the most highlyskilled young athletes working together like a welloiled machine to produce a meticulously executed routine absolutely </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the highrisk factor makes it all the more enthralling for the viewer too </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is not uncommon for a flyer the athlete literally thrown into the air to fall during a stunt </s>
<s> but dont worry  one of the first things you are taught is how to fall and catch in the safest way possible </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 2 </s>
<s> it will not be a onehorse race </s>
<s> as the current incarnation of cheerleading originated in north america it seems fitting that the first olympic medals would be contested in its homeland </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but there are many countries who will happily and convincingly challenge the prospective favourites team usa for the inaugural title </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> team usa have dominated but the gap is narrowing every year  the eagles were beaten in the allgirl premier division by finland this year </s>
<s> at this weeks world championships teams from mexico norway new zealand and chile all claimed podium finishes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> team england have historically been fierce competitors too </s>
<s> they have earned medals at the last three world championships  no mean feat </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and other powerhouse cheer nations such as japan canada and china have delivered stunningly creative and complex routines at the top level </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it may also surprise you that team finland have the potential to shock  they caused a huge upset in the hotlycontested allgirl premier division this year by beating team usa to the gold </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it has all the ingredients for a very exciting competition </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> 3 </s>
<s> it will finally give cheerleading the kudos it deserves </s>
<s> cheerleaders everywhere have been arguing with sceptics for years about its credibility  mainly about its status as a sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but if you were to look up the dictionary definition of sport it ticks every box </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> an activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> gold medallists also receive a coveted world champion ring </s>
<s> these athletes train just as hard as gymnasts for just as many hours as a synchronised swim team and compete as often as volleyball teams </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in 2019 three years after being granted provisional olympic status by the ioc cheerleading will be able to apply to become part of the full olympic games sports programme </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so la 2028 is not beyond the realms of possibility </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> cheerleading is a sport with growing popularity </s>
<s> it has a strong youth focus and we noted that ioc sports director kit mcconnell said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the icu has more than 100 national federations and almost 4 </s>
<s> 5 million registered athletes </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> a new height limit imposed on the sport has drawn both controversy and ridicule for its attempt to cut foreigners down to size </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> each team in south korea can have only two foreign players </s>
<s> starting with the 201819 season one of these players must not be taller than 200cm 6ft 6in while the other one cannot be taller than 186cm </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> just to be that close and not be able to make it kind of stinks </s>
<s> doesnt look like ill be going back there to play unless they change the rule again </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> simon who had topped the kbl in the previous basketball season had to head home to the us much to fans chagrin </s>

<s> its not the first time this has happened </s>
<s> in fact korea has had a height limit for foreign players since 1997 but this is the shortest that has ever imposed </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the kbl has maintained that it has to protect local players who on average cannot match the heights of foreign players mostly americans </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> the league has also said the height limit will lead to better games with higher scores and a faster pace </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we believe this new height restriction will revive the popularity of pro basketball in the country kbl secretary general lee sunghan told yonhap </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> is south korea alone in this </s>
<s> the lack of extremely tall local players appears to be particularly acute in asia where for every yao ming 229cm there are many more players of average height </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its one reason why the basketball league in the philippines has had for decades a 200cm height limit for foreign players as permitting american 7footers to play would wreak havoc reported slate magazine </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the debate has long overshadowed the sport </s>
<s> way back in 1957 sports illustrated magazine ran a discussion with both proponents and opponents arguing that either way a height limit was discriminatory </s>

<s> there are advantages and disadvantages both to being taller and shorter donyell marshall the mens head coach of basketball at central connecticut state universitys blue devil athletics told the bbc </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if youre taller you can score around the rim better you can block shots and you can rebound </s>
<s> but smaller players can usually shoot better </s>
<s> they are faster and better dribblers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so how do you shrink a basketball player </s>
<s> its a shadowy science </s>
<s> yonhap reported that the south korean teams tried lifting weights and jogging before measurement hoping that dehydration could knock off a few centimetres </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in the 1970s and 1980s when bouffant hairstyles were popular philippine teams would shave their foreign players heads to battle height restrictions reported slate </s>
<s> other methods employed over the years include doing shoulder presses and squats with the idea that this could compress their bones </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if all else failed some resorted to cheating  slouching bending their knees ever so slightly or leaning against the wall during measurement </s>
<s> but officials soon cottoned on  and simply measured the athletes while they lay flat on the ground </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> image copyrightgetty imagesimage captionthe kbl has claimed the height limit will lead to better games with higher scores and a faster pace </s>
<s> doctors say its almost impossible to shrink your body </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> first of all there hasnt been much of a market for shrinkage so theres hardly been any medical innovations </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its actually very rare </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> usually people want to grow taller and the technology has been there for that says dr tan chyn hong an orthopaedic surgeon and a former singapore national athlete </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if you want to lose a lot there is no reasonable way to do that  short of chopping your bones </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but not all hope is lost </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nonsurgically there are things you can do to a very small degree says dr tan </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the discs in your spine are composed of water amongst other things so for example if you dehydrate yourself you could perhaps lose a bit of height from the shrinking of the accumulated discs </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i would say from doing that and maybe also slouching a bit its possible to lose 1cm  but any more than that is very tough </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> the biggest thing ive learned is keep your composure under pressure and stay focused on yourself and not on what other athletes are doing </s>
<s> focus on yourself and dont be distracted by what goes on around you </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> one technique i use during a major championship is to listen to christian music </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i am quite unusual for a 400m runner in that im not really a fan of running the 100m or 200m </s>

<s> tip for surviving the athletics circuit </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i never liked travelling from meet to meet  i always feel so tired competing </s>
<s> but if i could pass on any advice it would be to learn to control your sleep when it is time to sleep </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> to help overcome the jetlag if i hop on a flight in the morning and it is evening in the place where i am flying to i try to sleep on the plane </s>
<s> it doesnt work out all the time but it helps </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i also try to hydrate as much as i can </s>
<s> i now feel less tired and it is reflected in my improved performances </s>
<s> my parents always told me i always knew what i wanted </s>

<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> well enough to attend my brothers wedding that weekend and shimmy around awkwardly on the dance floor </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> going for long walks and riding my bike alongside justin on his runs were my exercise of choice for the first few weeks after surgery </s>
<s> i enjoyed the perfect fall weather in minneapolis and even though i was a little sad i wasnt able to run in it i was just happy to be alive and presumably cancerfree </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i had to walk home from more than a couple of runs </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> fast forward to november and i was getting antsy about training for the upcoming track season </s>
<s> the abdominal muscles that were sliced through in august were still healing but getting closer to feeling normal </s>
<s> some manual therapy and exercises had helped expedite the process but i knew my body would heal in its own time  whether that took a few months or over a year remained to be seen </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i had dreams of an epic comeback this season  my goal was to be both fitter than ever and cancerfree  but i didnt get the fairytale ending i was hoping for at least not yet </s>
<s> i found out in march in my first postop scan that i still have cancer in my liver </s>
<s> were not sure if it is all new cancer or if some was left behind from the surgery </s>
<s> it doesnt really matter </s>
<s> there are small tumours too many for a surgery </s>
<s> i need treatment </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when im in the middle of a workout im not thinking about surviving cancer im just trying to survive the workout </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> since finding out about the new cancer i have used running as therapy much like i did through my three previous cancer experiences </s>
<s> the simple act of running is always a welcome diversion from the overwhelming uncertainty of my future </s>
<s> and you cant really cry while you run which is great when im in the middle of a workout im not thinking about surviving cancer im just trying to survive the workout </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i still dream about running fast this year and beyond but the truth is i dont really know whats going to happen or how much elite running is realistically in front of me </s>
<s> all i can do right now is approach each day like i approach each rep of a workout one at a time doing my best to hang on until the next one </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> next week i will travel to new york city to meet with a head  neck oncology specialist at memorial sloan kettering cancer center </s>
<s> there i will hopefully l figure out when i will start treatment and what i will start with first chemotherapy a clinical trial immunotherapy or some radiation technique </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so this is the scary part i have a rare cancer for which there is no cure and limited effective treatment options available </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i think its more fun because its a little riskier </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> she is right </s>
<s> broken poles and fractured bones are a regular occurrence on the international pole vault circuit </s>
<s> luckily the 18yearold has never snapped a pole in her life </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> little by little she dropped the other events </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> mother murtos hunch of her daughters potential in the pole vault proved right </s>
<s> in 2014 aged just 16 she competed at the world u20 championships in eugene oregon </s>
<s> last year she cleared an outright world u20 best of 4 </s>
<s> 71m in zweibrucken germany in january </s>

<s> if i think back now it was very good she reflects </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it wasnt perfect but nothing is perfect </s>
<s> i didnt wish for bronze in poland but all together i think it was good the way it was  i learnt more </s>
<s> it was much more experience for the future that way </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and experience  especially outdoors  is one of the key ingredients the 18yearold is still lacking </s>
<s> because she is still in high school in turku murto spends all of her winter in finland training indoors while most of her international competition heads off to warmer climates </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> rather than making excuses however she focuses on improving everything about her vaulting </s>
<s> technically pretty strong for her age she has a lot to catch up with physically in order to reach consistent heights </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i think because im tall everything takes more time  to build strength in the body she explains </s>
<s> this past indoor season she vaulted an u20 wl 4 </s>
<s> 66m in tignes france </s>
<s> now she is determined to carry those heights outdoors </s>
<s> consistency is the objective for now then the medals will follow </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i havent really thought about the world championships because for now i dont think to get all the medals is the main thing to focus on </s>
<s> i have years to do that </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> of course if everything goes well and training goes well in the spring why not go as high as i can in london also i have the european junior championships so that might be the main goal </s>
<s> i guess i could say i want the gold medal there so thats the one i can say for sure </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> this is a skill i needed to learn over time </s>
<s> i was not really a championship athlete from the beginning </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>

<s> i was chatting with the president of european athletics and asked have you thought this through </s>
<s> i am not convinced they have </s>
<s> all the member federations of european athletics will have to scrap their national records because you cant have a national record quicker than the european record and so on </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> part of the worst aspect of it is that in the document that they are putting forward they are talking about preserving the dignity of the athletes as well </s>
<s> its about preserving their own dignity </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its an easy cop out </s>
<s> they havent been able to make the tough decisions </s>
<s> if there are records that they believe that shouldnt be on the books then they should go after those with whatever scrutiny they have can </s>
<s> if they cant do that then this is their problem to deal with </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we all lose our records eventually </s>
<s> its fine somebody comes along and breaks it but what is not fair is that the federation decides that is not the record any more </s>
<s> as a broadcaster what do i say to the public </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in the early days there was no drug testing did we scrap all of those records no </s>
<s> then drug testing was introduced and now we have tougher drug testing </s>
<s> thats fine we all accept that </s>
<s> maybe some things slipped through the net in the past but you cant keep drawing a line every five years </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the farcical thing they are going to end up with is that there will still be people holding records who have had a ban  but the records they set were before the ban and those will still stand </s>

<s> now 63 years later an attempt will be made to shatter another of sports landmark times  a sub twohour marathon </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> bannisters mile was a triumph of corinthian values and spirit </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however this marathon  to be run in under 120 minutes  is organised by sportswear giant nike and the event taking place in northern italy on saturday morning has a distinctly corporate feel about it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is the ultimate endurance test but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so is it an expensive pr and marketing exercise </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> or given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26 </s>
<s> 2 miles should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights </s>
<s> the world record for the marathon was set by kenyas dennis kimetto in berlin in 2014 </s>
<s> his time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however it will be not be kimetto stepping up to this challenge </s>
<s> the job lies instead with his compatriot eliud kipchoge zersenay tadese of eritrea and lelisa desisa of ethiopia </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> kipchoge as the reigning olympic marathon champion perhaps has the greatest chance </s>
<s> his personal best of 203 </s>
<s> 05 set in london in 2016 is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> to break the twohour marathon barrier a runner would need to beat the fastestever marathon by about 3 </s>
<s> that means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the races 26 </s>
<s> 2 miles </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> therefore to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement  something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nike dont really do perceived wisdom though </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they have signed up the three elite performers paying them to forego the london and berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded breaking2 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> historical weather patterns have been studied and a threeday window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it has since been narrowed further and so at 0545 local time on saturday morning the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history but not the record books </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> this is because of the use of inout pacemakers 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level </s>
<s> their use is against athletics regulations so no matter what time is set on saturday morning it wont be considered a valid world record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nikes legion of scientists performance coaches nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance </s>
<s> mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners legs core temperature pills an ingestible thermometer that transmits data are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they dont waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nikes big corporate rival adidas is planning its own sub twohour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but nikes vice president of special projects sandy bodecker is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have even if it is under such controlled conditions </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the attempt is also notable in that the worlds media are being blocked from witnessing it </s>
<s> this is very much a behindcloseddoors event which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of formula 1 tifosi on race days </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it suggests that with everything else under tight control spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand </s>
<s> the very early start time no doubt presents logistical issues too </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> instead nike have allowed a few handpicked journalists to attend who have also covered the buildup to the big day </s>
<s> a web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> some supporters of the project have called it a moonshot given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> saturday 6 may is the preferred date which is also the 63rd anniversary of roger bannister breaking the fourminute barrier for the mile </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there are definite parallels </s>
<s> there was plenty of controversy about bannisters attempt just as there is about whats happening in monza </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been </s>
<s> if anyone can do this its eliud kipchoge </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but that still means him running more than three minutes faster than his current best </s>
<s> the man not the shoes nor the science will have to find most of that </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> championship tip </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the biggest thing for performing at a major championship is preparation </s>
<s> if you have prepared well for a whole year and given your best in every single workout then this will give you the confidence and ability to perform when it counts </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> another tip i would give for performing well at a major championship is to go through different scenarios in training </s>
<s> i visualise my last throw in training sessions as if it was the sixth round of a major championship and my last chance to win gold </s>
<s> this helps you perform under pressure </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its funny my favourite throw used to be ulf timmermanns olympic record of 22 </s>
<s> 47m and i used to go through the scenarios with my father and coach of trying to beat it </s>
<s> so when i set an olympic record of 22 </s>
<s> 52m in rio in my mind i had already broken that record a thousand times </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> i would say for younger athletes dont move away from the glide technique too early as it teaches you the fundamentals and some elements that the spin technique tends to overlook </s>

<s> tip for surviving the athletics circuit </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the best thing for me has been keeping a travel journal </s>
<s> in this i record the days when i have travelled </s>
<s> when i have felt good and bad what id done trainingwise how my body has responded to the flight how much food and water i need and what i need in terms of sleep the night i arrive </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> for example for me personally by keeping the journal i know travelling backwards in time works better for my body </s>

<s> tactical tip </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> set your end goals then set small goals as your plan to attack your main goal </s>
<s> over the years i noticed when i set small goals it felt like i accomplished more than when i was purely focusing on the big goal and not making it </s>

<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> european athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in january </s>
<s> its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce and it wants the sports world governing body the iaaf to adopt the changes it sets out </s>
<s> how will world records be recognised </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if the proposals are accepted by the iaaf a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> why are the changes needed </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the proposals are a response to last years mclaren report which uncovered widespread doping in sport  and athletics in particular </s>
<s> russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> more than 100 olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 games have been sanctioned for doping after the international olympic committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there will be athletes current record holders who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area he said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> european athletics president hansen said he would encourage the iaaf to adopt the proposal at its august council meeting </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> what we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and european records will have to be replaced hansen added </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board </s>
<s>  radcliffes statement in full </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> radcliffe has previously criticised plans to wipe records from the books and last month told bbc sport she favoured making doping a criminal offence instead to deter cheats </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> she issued a statement on monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i worked extremely hard for my pbs and they will always be valid to me </s>
<s> i know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them radcliffe wrote </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete here they again fail those athletes </s>
<s> we had to compete against cheats they couldnt provide us a level playing field we lost out on medals moments and earnings due to cheats saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our world and area records </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> although we are moving forward i dont believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there so why reset at this point do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity </s>
<s> it is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is confusing to the public at a time when athletics already struggles to market itself </s>
<s> how do they explain how stadium club and national records are better than the area or world marks or will they force all those to be to wiped out too </s>
<s> when sir roger bannister ran one mile in under four minutes on 6 may 1954 it was hailed as a groundbreaking moment for sport </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> his time of three minutes 59 </s>
<s> 4 seconds broke both psychological and physiological barriers </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> now 63 years later an attempt will be made to shatter another of sports landmark times  a sub twohour marathon </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> bannisters mile was a triumph of corinthian values and spirit </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however this marathon  to be run in under 120 minutes  is organised by sportswear giant nike and the event taking place in northern italy on saturday morning has a distinctly corporate feel about it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is the ultimate endurance test but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so is it an expensive pr and marketing exercise </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> or given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26 </s>
<s> 2 miles should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a place in history but not the record books </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the world record for the marathon was set by kenyas dennis kimetto in berlin in 2014 </s>
<s> his time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however it will be not be kimetto stepping up to this challenge </s>
<s> the job lies instead with his compatriot eliud kipchoge zersenay tadese of eritrea and lelisa desisa of ethiopia </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> kipchoge as the reigning olympic marathon champion perhaps has the greatest chance </s>
<s> his personal best of 203 </s>
<s> 05 set in london in 2016 is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> to break the twohour marathon barrier a runner would need to beat the fastestever marathon by about 3 </s>
<s> that means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the races 26 </s>
<s> 2 miles </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> therefore to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement  something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nike dont really do perceived wisdom though </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they have signed up the three elite performers paying them to forego the london and berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded breaking2 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> historical weather patterns have been studied and a threeday window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it has since been narrowed further and so at 0545 local time on saturday morning the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history but not the record books </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> this is because of the use of inout pacemakers 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level </s>
<s> their use is against athletics regulations so no matter what time is set on saturday morning it wont be considered a valid world record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> how are they trying to do this </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> inout pacemaking is just one facet of what is a complex and expensive operation </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> according to runners world magazine several locations were scouted worldwide in search of the perfect venue </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> courses in the netherlands chicago and berlin are all said to have been considered and eventually rejected </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> monza just north of milan is more used to hosting formula 1 races but was finally chosen because of its gentle corners climatic conditions and the fact its both flat and 600ft above sea level </s>
<s> so 17 </s>
<s> 5 laps of a 2400m course await </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nikes legion of scientists performance coaches nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance </s>
<s> mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners legs core temperature pills an ingestible thermometer that transmits data are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they dont waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and then theres the runners kit  or more specifically the shoes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nike says its own tests on a special new shoe  passed as legal by the international association of athletics federations iaaf technical committee  make runners up to 4 more efficient </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> transform a sport  the marketing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so is the attempt just about selling very expensive shoes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nikes big corporate rival adidas is planning its own sub twohour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but nikes vice president of special projects sandy bodecker is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have even if it is under such controlled conditions </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the sub twohour marathon barrier is one of those rare ones that if broken can transform a sport he says </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its the last big onceinageneration barrier it will impact the way runners view distance running and human potential forever </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its a big claim but very much in line with a company ethos that urges elite athletes and park plodders alike to just do it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> others however are critical of the attempt given the moneynoobject resources that have been thrown at it and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> is media presence a distraction </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the attempt is also notable in that the worlds media are being blocked from witnessing it </s>
<s> this is very much a behindcloseddoors event which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of formula 1 tifosi on race days </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it suggests that with everything else under tight control spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand </s>
<s> the very early start time no doubt presents logistical issues too </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> instead nike have allowed a few handpicked journalists to attend who have also covered the buildup to the big day </s>
<s> a web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> some supporters of the project have called it a moonshot given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so just like neil armstrongs famous first step on the lunar surface in 1969 the world will be required to watch and wonder </s>

<s> analysis  the man not the shoes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> bbc athletics commentator ed harry </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> amid the furore over proposals to not call anything pre2005 a world record theres some irony that we can get so excited about a race where a world record cant be set </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> saturday 6 may is the preferred date which is also the 63rd anniversary of roger bannister breaking the fourminute barrier for the mile </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there are definite parallels </s>
<s> there was plenty of controversy about bannisters attempt just as there is about whats happening in monza </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been </s>
<s> if anyone can do this its eliud kipchoge </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but that still means him running more than three minutes faster than his current best </s>
<s> the man not the shoes nor the science will have to find most of that </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if you want to start running but feel nervous about doing it on your own runtogether could be the answer </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a new national programme set up by england athletics runtogether aims to motivate people to improve their physical and mental health by running with others </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when i started running a couple of years ago i was very selfconscious about how others would perceive me she said </s>

<s> ive made some great friends in running groups and would encourage as many people to join their local group </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> matt birkett head of running participation at england athletics said we know that running with others is more effective in changing behaviour making people more likely to sustain a running habit and we know how much of an impact running has on improving emotional health and wellbeing </s>

<s>  unparalleled levels of success for his countrys competitors have been predicted by scottish athletics performance director roger harkins </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> laura muir won two gold medals eilish mccolgan a bronze and eilidh doyle a relay silver at the european indoor championships over the weekend </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> people hark back to the halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s harkins said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i genuinely believe scottish athletics is moving into an era where it will be unprecedented </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and he added if it continues along this vein then it will definitely be the best it has ever been </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there are so many talented athletes about at the moment  eilish laura steph twell andy butchart callum hawkins lynsey sharp to name but a few </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> weve got some good throwers as well and weve got some good kids coming through in the sprints and endurance events </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> muir won the 1500m and 3000m with mccolgan finishing third in the latter while doyle was part of britains 4x400m relay squad </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> harkins believes such successes are not only inspiring their colleagues but a new generation of kids coming through </s>
<s> if you go back 10 years there would only be a couple of scottish athletes in the gb team and those athletes have inspired a generation of the next athletes he told bbc scotland </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it was unprecedented that we have 15 athletes at the olympics in rio last year and six athletes at the paralympics </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however harkins did not anticipate increased government funding as a result </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i find that hard to imagine in the current economic climate particularly when they are talking about cuts across the board he said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> we can only hope that if athletics is doing well our money will not be cut </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> meanwhile harkins believes muir who plans to double up again at this years world championships could go on to become one of scotlands greatestever athletes </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> she certainly has the ability and the characteristics for that he said while praising the hard work put in by the 25yearold and her coach </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> shes had this potential for a number of years but to deliver the performances that she did and the manner in which she did them over the weekend is absolutely amazing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is great credit to the work andy young has been doing with her </s>
<s>  former european medallist lee mcconnell thinks that muir is already among scotlands alltime best </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> shes a fantastic athlete she said </s>
<s> the futures really bright for laura </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i think the biggest thing for her is that she needs to keep training the way shes training and try her best not to pick up any injuries </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> she didnt come back with a medal from rio but she was still outstanding on the athletics circuit with such quick times over 1500m </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> true laura style she went out in rio to win the gold medal and i think if she had decided she was happy with silver or bronze she would have probably come back with a silver or bronze </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the european indoor championships is a great chance for her and i know there has been some talk about her doubling up over 1500m and 5000m both indoors and outdoors this season </s>
<s> i am not sure whether laura has actually said that is what she definitely wants to do rather she has said the schedule allows it which is a little bit different </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the very fact that she is talking about it though shows she is obviously not setting her targets low which is great </s>
<s> you dont win things by not thinking big </s>
<s> laura has always struck me as quite quiet but she has never lacked confidence </s>
<s> ive seen her train quite a lot over the last few years  she doesnt have very many easy days </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> training in the bank </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> to be fair there arent many easy days for anyone out here </s>
<s> our group mainly consists of 800 or 1500m runners with the likes of laura weightman and kyle langford also in the group </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> this is a crucial time of year for them to get the endurance base that will carry them through the summer </s>
<s> its a bit of a departure for us from recent years in that we have come to south africa rather than iten in kenya </s>
<s> iten is about 8000 ft while potch is more like 4000ft </s>
<s> being at a slightly lower altitude means you can do a bit more quality work while still getting the benefit of being at altitude </s>

<s> but in the next couple of years there is a huge opportunity for some of the younger ones to get into the medal mix </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the athletes then sleep in altitude tents at night to get that added benefit too </s>
<s> the benefits of altitude are not a new thing to me  i wrote my dissertation about its benefits back in 1981 and i used to use it by training in colorado during my career  and in many ways the sport is very similar to when i did it </s>

<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> instead i had to say that it was a surprise that someone had improved five metres and that the champion nearly had to break the world record to win </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its weird thinking about it now </s>
<s> we would all joke about russian athletes and some others doping </s>
<s> we just had to accept that they were cheating </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i had initially tried to remain naive about it partly because i didnt feel at my own physical or mental peak </s>

<s> so brutally obvious </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its great now that people can openly talk about it </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> although richardsross does not think all world records set after 2005  the point from which under european athletics proposals records would be reset  are clean the 32yearold said i think theres a better chance and a higher ratio of them being clean </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> marita koch can we believe her 400m world record is genuine </s>
<s> koch competed during a time when it is known that east germany was doping its athletes but she has denied any wrongdoing and never failed a drugs test </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> its just not logical said the olympic 400m champion from london 2012 </s>

<s> 60 just blows your mind </s>

<s> it was achieved at a competition on a list of approved international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment can be guaranteed </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> this great british hope showed transitions boxing admirably early on taking punishment in the middle rounds and then switching things up to power punching seizing his moment with killer instinct </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> there were times where he showed his inexperience but he learned and showed he isnt just a prospect said joshuas trainer rob mccracken </s>

<s> david haye explains what makes the perfect punch </s>
<s> a misconception exists that a huge muscular guy can punch harder than a skinny guy </s>
<s> in my experience people who can move from one point to another quickly cannot only punch hard but knock out their opponents </s>
<s> throughout my career i have focused on being able to punch very fast and hit people where they cant see the punch </s>
<s> if you hit someone where theyre not aware there is going to be a punch landing they cant brace for it so the impact is much greater </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is hard to counter someone without speed unless you are very lucky and just wing a punch that your opponent doesnt see </s>
<s> timing is vital </s>
<s> speed and timing are both key but if your timing is out you cant land your punch </s>
<s> good balance is a crucial element of throwing a knockout punch </s>
<s> you need to be able to explode from your feet using every ounce of your weight </s>
<s> it is not about how strong your arms are  the key is to have a strong core in terms of your glutes hamstrings and quads </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> you need to generate power to explode through your target </s>
<s> it is not about how hard you can hit that person it is the velocity of the movement coming through the target that causes maximum impact </s>
<s> people who have high knockout ratios do not look to punch at their opponents chin they look to punch 12 inches through the chin and that motion is what leads to the knockout </s>

<s> mike davis is chief executive of the united states golf association usga which along with the st andrewsbased ra sets the rules of the game </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in recent decades courses all over the world have been forced to expand to accommodate the vast distances generated by modern players </s>
<s> they are helped by drivers with large sweetspots and balls that spin less and travel further </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> many courses have been rendered obsolete for the professional game because they are simply too short </s>
<s> others such as the old course at st andrews need to use tees outside the boundaries of the course to create the requisite distance to make holes sufficiently testing </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> former greats including jack nicklaus gary player and greg norman insist the ball is travelling too far </s>
<s> indeed nicklaus an 18time major champion told bbc sport last year it is the most ridiculous thing in the game </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> yet the authorities have done nothing to shorten the distance a ball flies </s>
<s> they appear accepting of the status quo and the ra and usga published recent data they claim proves that length off the tee has plateaued </s>
<s>  </s>

<s> in a wideranging interview with us online magazine golfworld he said my biggest regret would be what has happened with distance </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> its been the thing probably more than any that has been the most harmful to the game </s>
<s> billions of dollars have been spent to alter golf courses  and for what </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> davis acknowledges manufacturers do not want to make equipment that is less powerful and players love to see their ball travel long distances </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nobody wants to hit the ball shorter he said </s>
<s> on the other hand increased distance has had a profoundly negative effect on golf courses </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> theyve had to expand theyve had to use more resources to maintain </s>
<s> it takes more time to play </s>
<s> it takes more land and construction costs for new golf courses </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and in some cases architectural integrity has been compromised </s>
<s> are any of these things good </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i sometimes wish we could just snap our fingers and say were going to roll the entire golf world back on distance </s>
<s>  but the stark reality is that would be chaotic and would likely not be supported by the masses </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> and this is why we should not expect much change in the coming years despite the overwhelming logic that says a shorter game would make the sport cheaper and more attractive </s>

<s> he believes it is a genuine spectacle </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> davis though believes it is incumbent upon the rulesmakers to at least discuss the issue </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> weve really not talked about it he said </s>
<s> but with the ra and the usgas responsibility to look out to the future theres a genuine interest to say maybe we wont get there but shame on us if we dont at least talk about it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> during the lengthy interview davis raised a number of issues pertinent to the running of courses at the level of the humble amateur </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> in the uk we are entering a period of the year when our greens start to be shaved to maximise speed and rough is grown as fairways are narrowed </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> from personal experience these developments tend to be welcomed but postround many club golfers feel beaten by tricky penal course setups </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> davis who has been laying out us open courses since 2006 sympathises with those for whom the game is rendered too difficult </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> when i talk to architects for about 40 years hard equalled good he said </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> now youre definitely seeing that go in the other direction where fun equals good </s>
<s> these practices of narrower fairways higher rough not encouraging play from the proper tees its no good </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> today people equate fast greens with good greens </s>
<s> but fast greens cost more to maintain </s>
<s> fast greens are more susceptible to disease </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> fast greens compromise some of the architectural integrity of great courses </s>
<s> fast greens have absolutely caused more cases of the yips </s>
<s> and theyve hurt pace of play </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> davis also contends that fairway grass tends to be cut too short leaving tighter lies that make ballstriking and chipping more difficult </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> growing up we didnt hear about people skulling chip shots the 52yearold said </s>
<s> now you hear about the chip yips </s>
<s> so weve been trying to message keep your fairways drier but longer </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> whether this message is heard by golf clubs of the world remains to be seen </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but on the key issue of distance davis has shown he does have ears and has listened to the argument that the ball travels too far </s>

<s> wow when that ball hit the green i jumped so far out of my seat in the studio that i nearly landed in the azaleas bordering the set </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but one of the things that will always stay with me was when i first clapped eyes on augusta national for real </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> off i strode and immediately sought out sandys bunker at the 18th </s>

<s> he had needed a par at the last to force a playoff with mark calcavecchia </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i remember thinking back then in 88 that hed blown it </s>
<s> but out came the famous seven iron and sandy would hoist the ball up and on to the green before sinking the putt for a birdie to become the first british player to win the masters </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so years later there i stood looking into the impossibly white sand of that bunker and gazing up at the very large hill that lies in front of it up to the green </s>
<s> the contours of the course really dont translate properly on tv </s>
<s> so standing there in person underscored to me what a fantastic shot it really was </s>

<s> masters 2017 why sergio garcias win was so special </s>
<s> serenity was a word that sprang to mind throughout the epic masters that spawned sergio garcias maiden major victory </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the 37yearold broke through thanks to an apparent inner peace that enabled him to cope with all that augusta and the elements could throw at him </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> whether it was the gusty winds of the first two days or the intimidating lastday surge of justin rose as he collected a hattrick of frontnine birdies garcia remained unperturbed in becoming the only man to be subpar in all four rounds </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is a state of mind that was beyond the spaniard in pretty much all of his previous 73 attempts to win a major </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> i felt very calm garcia said during his champions news conference </s>
<s> i felt very at ease </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> is garcias win the perfect sporting story </s>
<s> amazing to join idols ballesteros and olazabal </s>
<s> watch the best shots from the 2017 masters </s>
<s> sitting there in his newly won green jacket it seemed garcia had finally found the secret  a key to unlock the major puzzle </s>
<s> and it could equip him well in his quest to ensure he does not become a onehit wonder at major level </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> this was particularly apparent when he recounted the events of the parfive 13th in his final round on sunday </s>
<s> he had bogeyed the 10th and 11th and now his drive caught a tree and dropped into an unplayable position beneath a bush </s>

<s> and if not well shake justins hand and congratulate him for winning </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so i think i did that very well throughout the whole week and its something i need to keep improving and keep getting better at it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> if he is able to regularly harness this new outlook he will become a formidable force at future majors </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> a better mental attitude would work in tandem with impressive physical conditioning that shows no sign of deterioration </s>
<s> garcia had played 71 consecutive majors heading into the masters </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> that speaks volumes for his longevity and consistency at the top of the game despite several relative troughs before this standout peak in his career graph </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> now he is entitled to feel as though he can swiftly become a multiple major champion in the way padraig harrington did a decade ago </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> garcia was twice the fallguy when the irishman claimed his three crowns starting with victory in 2007 at carnoustie where the spaniard narrowly missed a putt for victory </s>

<s> in 1998 mark omeara who was four years older than garcia is now claimed his first major with a thrilling masters triumph </s>
<s> later that year he went to the merseyside course and doubled his major tally </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> whether garcia can emulate such a feat is subject to many factors  the form of rivals the state of his game and how the draw is affected by seaside weather </s>

<s> now 63 years later an attempt will be made to shatter another of sports landmark times  a sub twohour marathon </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> bannisters mile was a triumph of corinthian values and spirit </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however this marathon  to be run in under 120 minutes  is organised by sportswear giant nike and the event taking place in northern italy on saturday morning has a distinctly corporate feel about it </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it is the ultimate endurance test but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> so is it an expensive pr and marketing exercise </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> or given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26 </s>
<s> 2 miles should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights </s>
<s> the world record for the marathon was set by kenyas dennis kimetto in berlin in 2014 </s>
<s> his time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> however it will be not be kimetto stepping up to this challenge </s>
<s> the job lies instead with his compatriot eliud kipchoge zersenay tadese of eritrea and lelisa desisa of ethiopia </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> kipchoge as the reigning olympic marathon champion perhaps has the greatest chance </s>
<s> his personal best of 203 </s>
<s> 05 set in london in 2016 is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> to break the twohour marathon barrier a runner would need to beat the fastestever marathon by about 3 </s>
<s> that means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the races 26 </s>
<s> 2 miles </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> therefore to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement  something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nike dont really do perceived wisdom though </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> they have signed up the three elite performers paying them to forego the london and berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded breaking2 </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> historical weather patterns have been studied and a threeday window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it has since been narrowed further and so at 0545 local time on saturday morning the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history but not the record books </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> this is because of the use of inout pacemakers 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level </s>
<s> their use is against athletics regulations so no matter what time is set on saturday morning it wont be considered a valid world record </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nikes legion of scientists performance coaches nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance </s>
<s> mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners legs core temperature pills an ingestible thermometer that transmits data are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they dont waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> nikes big corporate rival adidas is planning its own sub twohour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but nikes vice president of special projects sandy bodecker is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have even if it is under such controlled conditions </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> the attempt is also notable in that the worlds media are being blocked from witnessing it </s>
<s> this is very much a behindcloseddoors event which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> there will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of formula 1 tifosi on race days </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> it suggests that with everything else under tight control spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand </s>
<s> the very early start time no doubt presents logistical issues too </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> instead nike have allowed a few handpicked journalists to attend who have also covered the buildup to the big day </s>
<s> a web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track </s>
<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> some supporters of the project have called it a moonshot given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point </s>

<s> saturday 6 may is the preferred date which is also the 63rd anniversary of roger bannister breaking the fourminute barrier for the mile </s>

<s> there are definite parallels </s>

<s>  </s>
<s>  </s>
<s> but an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been </s>
<s> if anyone can do this its eliud kipchoge </s>
<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> his predecessor raouraoua had asked all local clubs to invest in academies zetchi has admitted that such a goal may be unrealistic </s>

<s>  </s>

<s>  </s>
<s> the project is run by jeanmarc guillou academies who previously worked with asec mimosas in ivory coast which produced the likes of the toure brothers and salomon kalou </s>
