This season is the first time Aves have ever managed to survive in the top flight for more than one season at a time. Sporting Lisbon suffered a shock 2-1 defeat by Aves in the Portuguese Cup final, five days after players were attacked by fans.A 50-strong group of hooded fans attacked players and officials at Sporting's training base on Tuesday. The club considered pulling out of the final, but the players decided to go ahead with the fixture.
However, they were beaten by Aves, a team who have spent only three years in the Portuguese top flight since 1930.It was a first appearance in the final for Aves, who narrowly avoided relegation this season.Alexandre Guedes scored the opening goal for Aves after 16 minutes in Oeiras and then edged them closer to the trophy with a second with 15 minutes left.Sporting fans turned their backs on the match and walked out after Aves' second goal and some were seen to clash with police.Colombian substitute Fredy Montero pulled a goal back on 85 minutes, but it was too late for Sporting who were repeatedly denied by Aves' 42-year-old former Portugal international goalkeeper Quim. Sporting, who have not won the Portuguese title since 2002, finished third in the Primeira Liga following a defeat at Maritimo in their final game of the season and missed out on a place in the Champions League qualifying rounds.Mumbai Indians, captained by Rohit Sharma, have won the IPL three times, more than any other sideDefending champions Mumbai Indians failed to reach the play-off stage of the Indian Premier League after defeat by Delhi Daredevils on Sunday.A win would have given the tournament's most successful team a top-four finish but Mumbai lost by 11 runs.Kings XI Punjab lost to the Chennai Super Kings by five wickets on Sunday, meaning they are also eliminated.
That result meant the Rajasthan Royals join Chennai, Kolkata Knight Riders and Sunrisers Hyderabad in the play-offs.Rajasthan lost four of their first seven matches but improved in the second half of the group stage, helped by England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler who scored five consecutive fifties and 548 runs in total.England all-rounder Ben Stokes also played 13 matches for Rajasthan - scoring 196 runs and taking eight wickets - but both he and Buttler have returned to play for England in the first Test against Pakistan, which starts on Thursday.England batsman Sam Billings was out for a duck for Chennai but they still secured victory to knock out Kings XI who needed to win by 53 runs to qualify.Chennai are returning to the IPL for the first time after they were suspended for two years for corruption, along with Rajasthan, and continue their record of reaching the play-offs in all the IPL seasons they have competed in since the tournament began in 2008.Standings, fixtures and how the play-offs workIndian Premier League standings after group stageStandingsPointsQ Sunrisers Hyderabad 18Q Chennai Super Kings18Q Kolkata Knight Riders16Q Rajasthan Royals145.

Last month, Hughes finished first in the Commonwealth Games 200m but was disqualified for impeding gold medallist Jereem Richards.The sprint races in Boston were taking place on a special 200m straight track.Britain's Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake finished second in the 150m behind 20-year-old American Noah Lyles.Tuchel has previously managed Mainz and Borussia Dortmund in the BundesligaNeymar is "an artist" who needs "special treatment", says his new Paris St-Germain boss Thomas Tuchel.German Tuchel spoke to the media on Sunday for this first time since his appointment on a two-year deal.Neymar, who joined PSG last August from Barcelona for a world-record fee of 222 million euros, has been linked with a move to Real Madrid.
"Artists are special players, they need special treatment, it's common sense," said Tuchel, 44."I met him last Sunday and it was a very good meeting. He's an artist, an exceptional player, one of the best in the world."Tuchel, who left his role at Borussia Dortmund a year ago, will officially begin his new job in time for the start of pre-season training in July as he replaces Spaniard Unai Emery.Neymar won the French Player of the Year prize despite a foot injury, meaning he has not featured for his club since the end of February.He has been named in Brazil's squad for the World Cup in Russia, which starts on 14 June.Despite constant speculation, PSG president Nasser Al-Khelaifi has denied that the 26-year-old striker will leave after just one year in Ligue 1.Tuchel added: "I met a very friendly, very open guy for the first time. "We started talking about soccer and I saw a smile on his face and that is what I want to see."If we find a way to build a structure around him, so he can show all his talent on the pitch, I think we have a key player to win our games."Fury's comeback fight will take place at Manchester ArenaFormer world heavyweight champion Tyson Fury will fight Albania's Sefer Seferi when he makes his comeback in Manchester on 9 June.Fury, 29, has not fought since claiming the IBF, WBA and WBO titles from Wladimir Klitschko in November 2015.Seferi, 39, has boxed at cruiserweight for most of his professional career but will face Fury at heavyweight.
He has only lost once in 24 bouts and has fought four times since Fury's last bout against Klitschko. Fury has won all 25 of his professional fights but was suspended in 2016 amid "anti-doping and medical issues" and accepted a backdated two-year ban in December 2017.During his absence, fellow Briton Anthony Joshua has taken the IBF, IBO, WBA and WBO world heavyweight titles, while unbeaten American Deontay Wilder holds the WBC belt.Fury had his boxing licence reinstated this year and signed with promoter Frank Warren.When the date for his return to the ring was announced last month, Fury said "I can't wait to get in there and prove I am the best even after all this time out."Seferi's only career defeat came at heavyweight in 2016 against Manuel Charr.Barcelona paid tribute to Andres Iniesta with a long show after the matchAndres Iniesta capped his stellar career at Barcelona with victory over Real Sociedad in his final game.The Spain midfielder, 34, is leaving the La Liga champions at the end of the season after winning 22 major titles in 16 years with the senior side.Fans formed a mosaic with the message 'Forever Iniesta' prior to the game.
Iniesta was typically assured in possession but the tired hosts needed a stunning strike by Philippe Coutinho to end their season with a win.Torres scores twice in final game for AtleticoThe former Liverpool midfielder cut in from the left and curled a powerful effort in off the far post on 57 minutes.Iniesta, who captained the side, was replaced in the 82nd minute, embracing all of his team-mates and acknowledging the Nou Camp crowd with tears in his eyes.After full-time the stadium went dark before a light show during which the Barcelona players emerged wearing Iniesta shirts to form a guard of honour.The man himself then strode out to raise first the La Liga then the Copa del Rey trophies, the fourth time he has won both in the same season, before addressing the crowd."This is a difficult day but I have spent 22 marvellous years here," he said. "It's been a pride and a pleasure to defend and represent this badge, which for me is the best in the world."Thanks to all my team-mates, each and every one. I will miss you all so much. And thank you to the fans, for all your love, everything you've made me feel since I arrived here as a boy. I leave as a man. I will keep you in my heart forever."'Forever Iniesta'
A mosaic message reading 'Forever Iniesta' was formed by the Barcelona fans before kick-offHaving joined the Barcelona youth set-up aged 12, Iniesta ends his 22-year association with the club after making 674 senior appearances, second only to long-time central midfield partner Xavi who made 767 and was present in the stadium.He was part of Barca sides that won La Liga nine times, four Champions League titles, three Club World Cups and six Copa del Rey trophies. The last of the league titles came this season as Barcelona almost went the whole campaign unbeaten, only to fall to a 5-4 defeat by Levante in their penultimate game.The hosts were subdued against a stubborn Real Sociedad, the game itself of secondary importance to bidding farewell to one of their greatest ever players.Lionel Messi even started on the bench before replacing Coutinho on 67 minutes to enjoy a final cameo alongside Iniesta, the pair having won all 22 of those trophies together.When granted an emotional send-off in being replaced by Paco Alcacer, Iniesta went straight to Messi, handing over the captain's armband and hugging the Argentina striker.He could not quite toast his final game with a goal - he came closest in dragging a shot narrowly wide on nine minutes - but showed plenty of his trademark deft touches, slick passes and quick feet throughout.Iniesta, who has been linked with a move to the Chinese Super League but not said where he will play next season, now turns his attention to this summer's World Cup in Russia, with Spain's squad for the tournament set to be announced on Monday.In 129 international appearances to date, he scored the winning goal in the 2010 World Cup final and also won the European Championship in 2008 and 2012.In a weekend of farewells - Gianluigi Buffon played his final game for Juventus, Fernando Torres said goodbye to Atletico Madrid, while this match was also Xabi Prieto's last for Real Sociedad - Iniesta had the most ostentatious send-off, the Barcelona squad still gathered on the pitch an hour after the final whistle to watch a fireworks show.

Live scores, schedule and resultsAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phoneYou can watch the FA Cup live on BBC One and the BBC Sport website, with coverage starting at 16:10 BST on Saturday.Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho really needs to win the FA Cup final because then he can turn around and say he has had a good season.If he doesn't then it has been average. Finishing runners-up in the Premier League is just par for a club the size of United.
With the amount they have spent on players then, if you consider they were a distant second behind Manchester City, it is not the step forward that Mourinho would have wanted for his second year in charge.United win would set up showdown with City
FA Cup: Every Man Utd goal from this year's FA Cup
United need trophies and so does Mourinho. This is the last game of the season and he signs off for the summer by lifting the FA Cup then the fans will look on him in a different light.Will they still be moaning about the football being dull and boring if they go and beat Chelsea 2-0 on Saturday and play extremely well? No, they will be thinking that next year, with a couple more players, they will be a much better team.It would also set up a Community Shield tie against Manchester City for everyone to look forward to ahead of the new season and another showdown between rivals Mourinho and Pep Guardiola.
Too many Man Utd critics - Mourinho
A lot of the time the curtain raiser to the new campaign is not much of a contest but that one would be, because it would be another trophy as far as Mourinho is concerned and he would take great pleasure in beating Guardiola too.Of course United have to get there first, though, and I am not sure it is going to be that easy for them.Will Lukaku look a little bit leaden?
Highlights: Man Utd 2-1 Tottenham
I presume Romelu Lukaku will start up front for United but he has not played since he came off injured against Arsenal at the end of April.At his best he is a key player for United, I think he will enjoy playing against Chelsea's three centre-halves and will cause them problems if so.But he will not have played for 20 days by the time the game kicks off and I think that will affect his performance.Big strikers like Lukaku need to be playing every week otherwise they lose their sharpness, which will be very important against the Chelsea defence.My fear is that the Belgian international will look a little bit leaden, so the key to United's success could be Alexis Sanchez, who has improved of late.In the FA Cup semi-final against Tottenham he looked like the player we know he can be and United really need a repeat performance from him at Wembley.United play football with the handbrake on
Where heroes are made: The Road to Wembley - fans' FA Cup poem
If United midfielder Paul Pogba has a good game, then he could be the difference - but it is a big if.Do you actually think Jose will say to Pogba on the day, before a big game against opponents like Chelsea, "go on, just go out and play - get involved absolutely everywhere".If he does, United would have a far better chance of winning, but it won't happen. With Jose in charge they play football with the handbrake on.When you are on the autobahn and behind the wheel of a Ferrari, you don't drive at 60mph, do you?But that is where United are at, which is why I think Chelsea will win.A chance for Conte to bow out in style
Relive all Chelsea's goals in this year's FA Cup
I don't think the result will make any difference to whether Blues manager Antonio Conte stays in his job, he is likely gone either way.This is like a farewell party for him, and a chance to go out with a bang on a big occasion.Chelsea's performances have been poor recently but come Saturday I think their players will have a real go. Even if you don't like the manager, if you are in a cup final and there is a medal at stake then you are going to give everything you have got.Willian has been their best player this season and, if he and Eden Hazard play well, they are going to be difficult to stop.I am not expecting a thrilling encounter, mind you, I have a feeling this is going to be quite a dour game.That would suit Mourinho in lots of ways, but I just think Chelsea are going to somehow going to come out on top, and allow Conte to say goodbye the way he wants to.PREDICTION: CHELSEA TO WIN 1-0Lawro was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.
Can love conquer all on an FA Cup Final date?
Lawro's Premier League predictions - the final league tableLawro made a prediction for all 380 Premier League games this season and the final table based on all of his predictions is at the bottom of this page.In Lawro's league table, Manchester City finished as champions and he also got the top six in the correct order, as well as Swansea in 18th.Liverpool did not lose a game in Lawro's league table for a second successive season, but the former Reds defender insists there is no bias involved.Lawro said: "I did not know it had happened again until I was told about it recently - but Liverpool are unbeaten in real life too, aren't they?"Seriously, though, I don't pay any attention to the table when I make my predictions. "The main reason the top teams often stay unbeaten in my table is that I don't tip any of them to lose very often full-stop - they don't, so why would I?
Lawro's predictions correctly saw Manchester United win the title in 2013 and Manchester City in 2014... and again this seasonHow did Lawro do last week?From the final day of Premier League fixtures, Lawro got five correct results, with no perfect scores, from 10 matches for a total of 50 points.He was beaten by England netball head coach Tracey Neville, who got six correct results, including one perfect score, for a total of 90 points.Total scores after week

Former skipper Patrick Vieira has been contacted, while ex-Barcelona coach Luis Enrique and Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri have also been linked.
So what is the latest situation in the search for a new boss at Emirates Stadium?Lots of talk - but is the job Arteta's for the taking?
Mikel Arteta (left) is an assistant to Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola (right)Arsenal's priority from the moment Wenger announced he would be leaving at the end of the season after nearly 22 years in charge has been to lead a comprehensive recruitment process.Wenger came close to departing a year ago and Arsenal's subsequent travails made it increasingly likely he would go this summer, so they are sure to have been surveying the managerial market for some time.In the interim period that market has changed - and so has the make-up of the Gunners' hierarchy - but they would have had a clear idea of who they wanted to talk with.While it is possible that discreet scouting, due diligence and enquiries to establish potential interest and availability may have been conducted while Wenger's future was undecided, out of respect I do not think any significant moves took place behind his back.That meant the club missed the chance to pursue a coach they admire in Thomas Tuchel. The German viewed Arsenal as his perfect destination but could not afford to wait until the Wenger situation was resolved and potentially lose the opportunity to join Paris St-Germain.The problems between Tuchel and Arsenal's head of recruitment Sven Mislintat from their time together at Borussia Dortmund were repairable, but Tuchel accepted PSG's offer to replace Unai Emery to end any idea of him joining the Gunners.Whether or not the reported interest in Germany boss Joachim Low was genuine, it would never have materialised because he was always planning to sign a new contract with the national team.Meanwhile, and for various reasons, the likes of Diego Simeone of Atletico Madrid, former Barcelona manager Luis Enrique, three-time Champions League winner Carlo Ancelotti and Celtic's Brendan Rodgers were never seriously considered.There is, though, said to have been enormous interest in the vacancy and after a long list was reduced to a shortlist, Juventus coach Allegri, Manchester City assistant Arteta and New York City boss Patrick Vieira emerged as the leading contenders.Arteta and Vieira were definitely spoken to and - whether directly or indirectly - Allegri was too.In this tightly guarded process it is unclear if - and to what extent - there was contact with Julian Nagelsmann of Hoffenheim, Belgium assistant Thierry Henry, outgoing PSG boss Emery and Monaco's Leonardo Jardim.What we do know is that Arsenal have held formal interviews and in-depth negotiations.Their hope is to make the right decision, rather than a quick one. They insist the new man will continue the values instilled by Wenger, play exciting and progressive football, represent Arsenal well and integrate young players.Arteta is the frontrunner - he wants the job and there is a feeling among staff that he is set to get it - but while it would seem Vieira has drifted out of contention, whispers persist that Allegri remains in the mix.
Massimiliano Allegri has won four consecutive Serie A titles with JuventusHow has the club's new structure impacted the manager search?Chief executive Ivan Gazidis is overseeing a major overhaul of Arsenal's sporting operation.In the past year, Mislintat has arrived as head of recruitment, Raul Sanllehi as head of football relations, Huss Fahmy as contract negotiator and Darren Burgess as director of high performance.Former captain Per Mertesacker will take over as academy manager this summer, joined there by ex-Gunners midfielder Freddie Ljungberg in a role still to be decided.So a framework has been created to prepare for life after Wenger - and now the Frenchman is gone, many of his longest-serving lieutenants have followed.Contract and transfer negotiator Dick Law and chief scout Steve Rowley had already moved on before Wenger's sidekick Boro Primorac, first-team coach Neil Banfield, goalkeeping coach Gerry Peyton, fitness coach Tony Colbert, equipment manager Paul Johnson and head of medical services Colin Lewin were all released.There have also been major structural and intellectual developments at the youth training base at Hale End and the senior one at London Colney as the hierarchy attempt to transform Arsenal back into a competitive force.Contrary to popular opinion, it is consistently reiterated by the club that American owner Stan Kroenke is desperate for success and it might not be coincidental that a lot of the changes have come as his son, Josh - a fellow director - has spent a greater amount of time around Arsenal, become a more visible presence and exerted increasing influence.In a divergence from the previous regime - Wenger retained total power over football matters and built the surrounding structure around himself - Arsenal will now adopt a continental model. The day-to-day power will be held by the leadership group, they will define the structure and a head coach must slot into it.The search for Wenger's successor is the responsibility of Gazidis, aided by Sanllehi and Mislintat, and they will present their recommendation to the board for approval; Fahmy is handling all contract matters; and Burgess is carrying out most of the technical changes, particular on the medical side.Are fans and the club on the same page?
Arsenal fans paid tribute to Arsene Wenger in his final games in charge but some sections of the support had called for him to leave earlierIn addition to the criteria Arsenal are seeking from their next manager, Gazidis said the club need to be "open-minded" and "brave".He pointed out that Wenger was hardly a household name when he joined in 1996, adding: "That doesn't mean we have to make another appointment that not everybody is thinking and talking about, but it does mean we need to be bold and get the person we believe is the right person."The implication is that the Gunners are not averse to taking a gamble, which theoretically is what somebody of Arteta's minimal experience represents compared to the likes of a proven Allegri.Gazidis is known to rate Arteta extremely highly and you sense the chief executive would have no hesitation about placing him at the helm.This contrasts with the feeling among sections of the Arsenal support, where the reaction to the Spaniard's candidacy has been mixed.There would be fewer reservations over an Allegri-type appointment, which would undoubtedly generate more initial excitement and help galvanise a fanbase that became divided and apathetic towards the end of Wenger's reign.That said, of those who have emerged as the most credible options, none would receive a hostile reception. There was sufficient clamour for change so the new man will be given a fair crack.A prospective concern for Arsenal's hierarchy is that with power comes accountability and the removal of Wenger strips them of a shield that had provided such robust protection for so long.That is one of several reasons why it is so important to get this appointment right.The relationship between the fans and hierarchy is not good. If this goes badly and the supporters are further angered and alienated, then trouble looms.Au revoir, Arsene - Arsenal fan Dermot O'Leary says goodbye'The brilliant revolutionary who refused to change'The other big question - how much will the new boss have to spend?
Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno has been one of the players linked with ArsenalWe are told Arsenal have a budget for the summer transfer window of around £50m.Of course, that can be bolstered by the proceeds of any sales but, if true, it is meagre in comparison to their rivals.So 'big-name' signings are unrealistic and they will have to be creative and maximise the connections and experience that Mislintat and Sanllehi bring.There is a perception that a lack of finance is among the factors contributing to an apparent struggle to lure a manager of Allegri's calibre, though Arsenal reject this and are adamant their job is one of the most attractive in world football.It is understood player recruitment was an area discussed with interviewed candidates and therefore any signings made before or after the appointment will supposedly have the incoming manager's blessing.As per the continental model, Arsenal's new head coach will contribute to recruitment decisions and retain the power of veto, but unlike in the past he will not be the only voice that matters.Mislintat will lead the search and pursue agreed targets, with Sanllehi charged with closing the deals.The acquisition of centre-back Konstantinos Mavropanos and forward Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in January was largely the work of Mislintat, a sign of things to come.Arsenal are reportedly in the hunt for a new goalkeeper, centre-back and holding midfielder.Among those they have been linked with are Bayer Leverkusen keeper Bernd Leno, Borussia Dortmund defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos and Nice midfielder Jean-Michael Seri.In the effort to raise additional funding, exit speculation has focused on defender Hector Bellerin and midfielder Aaron Ramsey.What about Wenger? Is he enjoying the time off?
Frenchman Wenger managed 1,235 games at ArsenalWenger said his goodbyes when they squad returned to London from Huddersfield following Sunday's last game of the Premier League season.He travelled to France on Monday to fulfil some media commitments and will return to London Colney only to tie up some loose ends and clear his office, although most items have already been given away by the 68-year-old outgoing boss.Some colleagues are expecting to see him for one final time on Monday, but that may be difficult considering it is highly possible the new manager could be announced next week.Wenger was flooded with gifts and mementos to mark the end of his 22-year tenure. However, what meant more to him than any of them was an invitation from the players to join them at their end-of-season dinner.Media playback is not supported on this device
John Motson explains his decision to hang up his microphone with the BBC
Watch a special night of BBC shows dedicated to John Motson on BBC Two on 19 May from 20:30 BSTMy last season as a commentator has come to an end, but I feel like I am going out on a high.It has been an incredibly exciting season with how Manchester City have played and the records they have broken. Pep Guardiola's side have really lit up my final year in the commentary box. They have really brought about a significant change in English football with the style they have developed and the ability they have shown throughout their championship-winning campaign. Since my retirement was announced, I've had a wonderful reception from all the clubs I have been to this season and have been given some fantastic gifts. I got a sky-blue sheepskin coat at Manchester City, while Arsenal presented me with a lovely silver cannon in a beautiful case.
I have almost been embarrassed by the reception I have had. Every club has been so hospitable and I've even been told I'm welcome to come back when I'm retired, which is very nice because I don't want to lose my contact with football.The fans have also shown me a great deal of warmth and affection which I will always be grateful for.Quiz: How well do you know Motty?'Ronnie's rocket helped shaped my career'
FA Cup classics: Hereford United v Newcastle, 1972My very first TV commentary was a scoreless draw between Liverpool and Chelsea in October 1971. It was not a very distinguished game or a distinguished commentary either I might add.The one that put me on the map was my first FA Cup tie when Hereford beat Newcastle in a third-round replay in 1972 with Ronnie Radford's goal - everyone will remember that.I was still on trial that year on television so it was a big day for me. I went down there thinking that Newcastle were going to have a comfortable win.The guy who drove me down to Hereford for the game was called Billy Meadows, he was their centre-forward. He took me down with Rickie George, who was to come and score the winning goal in extra time after Radford hit a 40-yarder.Billy then drove us home, because they both lived near me in Barnet, and we sat in Billy's front room and had fish and chips and listened to American Pie before Match of the Day came on and there, wonder of wonders, was my match propelled to the top of the show.I didn't look back after that because the BBC realised then I was capable of commentating on important matches.Going with the flow
Gazza's tears & the Crazy Gang: Five of Motty's best
I have always tried to be spontaneous. I have never planned before the game things I was going to say if so and so happens.I suppose the comment people mostly associate with me is when Wimbledon beat Liverpool in the 1988 FA Cup final and I said "the Crazy Gang have beaten the Culture Club". That was definitely spur of the moment because people did not really expect Wimbledon to win.I had gone down to Plough Lane a couple of weeks before to watch Wimbledon. Dennis Wise took a corner and Lawrie Sanchez ran across and flicked it in with his head. I made a mental note of that and then the same thing happened in the final.What I'll also never forget from that game was being able to get into the Wimbledon dressing room with Des Lynam. I had never been in a team's dressing room straight after a cup final but Wimbledon were that kind of club. They were down to earth and we built up a good relationship with them.Things like that and cup finals, internationals, World Cups and European Championships have all been my highlights. These are the memories I treasure the most.My memorable games
1982 World Cup - Rossi hat-trick sinks BrazilI've commentated on thousands of football matches but I would have to say there are two that I will always remember.The first would be the Italy-Brazil game at the 1982 World Cup in Spain when Paolo Rossi scored a hat-trick. Brazil only needed a draw to go through to the semi-finals but they went on attacking and the Italians beat them thanks to Rossi's goals.It was a fantastic game. Sir Bobby Charlton, co-commentating next to me, was in tears because it was so emotional at the end. Brazil thought they had a team to win the World Cup and to rival their 1970 side.Rossi, who was returning from a ban for match-fixing, made himself a hero at that tournament and Italy went on to win the final, beating West Germany which, by the way, was my first World Cup final as a commentator.The other game I will always remember was when England beat Germany 5-1 in Munich in a World Cup qualifier in 2001 under Sven-Goran Eriksson.I'd experienced so many disappointments with England as a commentator so this was a match that really will live long in the memory. I never expected such a performance on German soil.Michael Owen's hat-trick will always come back to me. I said: "It is getting better and better and better." And, of course, it did.Funnily enough, a few weeks later I was at West Ham and someone tapped me on the should and said: "It is getting better and better and better." I turned round and it was Eriksson!England still had to work hard to qualify and another game that is still fresh in my memory was when David Beckham equalised against Greece at Old Trafford with a last-minute free-kick, which made sure we were going to the World Cup finals.'Gazza was the best English player I have ever seen'
Paul Gascoigne's sublime Euro '96 goal against ScotlandI've been lucky to have seen some great teams at international and club level during my career.The Liverpool team of the late 1970s and early 1980s is a team that was absolutely outstanding and then of course Manchester United came along with Sir Alex Ferguson's different teams. I have seen the whole of Arsene Wenger's Arsenal career and now we have this Manchester City team.I have seen some of the finest teams and managers of the game, and I've experienced the influx of overseas players which has been one of the biggest developments in my time at the microphone - the Eric Cantonas and the Thierry Henrys.However, I think the outstanding English player I have seen was probably Paul Gascoigne. He would be right up there with all those fine overseas players we have seen come in and have still got in the Premier League.Shirt numbers and substitutions 
Archive: MOTD's tribute to John MotsonCommentating these days is more difficult in some ways - and easier in others.What has made it more difficult now is the shirt numbers. It used to be a simple 1-11 and you knew where everybody was going to play - and now, of course, the numbers vary, so you get 24, 38, 56, etc. That is more difficult because you can't remember numbers as easily as when they are consecutive.The other thing that has changed is the substitutes. When I started there was only one substitute, so you only had 12 players to worry about, but now there are seven so that's 18 players - and that is just on one side.When they change them quickly in the last 10 minutes - each team being allowed to put three on and take three off - the names do get a little jumbled up in your mind and you have to try and change the line-up in your head and hope you have the right player on and off.Where it might be easier is that when I started in 1971, with Barry Davies as the other main commentator, we didn't get a replay of any goals because the only replay machine was used for horse racing. That meant when a goal was scored, Barry and I had to pack it with words as the players went back to the centre circle and hope that we got the build-up right.Match of the Day editors didn't put the replays in until that evening, so there was a bit of a nervous wait to see if you had actually described the build-up to the goal correctly.The moments I'll miss
John Motson was still producing his colour-coded notes for every match this seasonI will miss the moment of excitement and adrenaline when they kick off, particularly at 3pm on a Saturday which I have been doing for 50 years.Perhaps I won't miss so much the hassle of preparing for the games - checking and re-checking facts - and the travelling. All the preparation is quite demanding on the commentator, particularly on the Thursday and Friday of every week.I'll miss the friendship and connection and contact with lots of people both in broadcasting and the football world.And a piece of advice for budding commentators...You just need hard work and perseverance.Get to know the game and the people in it. Identify the players, never mind all the facts and figures you can bring in, that has to be the number one requirement. I don't think that has changed in 50 years.Legendary football commentator John Motson is to be celebrated with a special night of BBC shows on 19 MayIt's the end of an era.John Motson, the voice of football, has retired but the legend of the microphone has more than left his mark on the world of football commentary.Many of us have grown up with football being played to the sound of 'Motty' but just how well do you know him and the many moments he has commentated on?

Monday, 21 May - rest daySimon says: After a long transfer we will normally sleep in as long as possible. We'll take a look at stage 16's individual time trial course in the morning but rest is just as, if not more, important. So, after we have ridden over what is a reasonably straightforward TT we will retreat to the team hotel and just lay low and focus on what surely will be one of the most crucial show downs of the entire Giro.Stage 16: Tuesday, 22 May - Individual time trial, Trento-Rovereto, 34.2km
Simon says: Survival day. Before the race even started we knew today was our danger day. Days like today are made for Chris Froome and Tom Dumoulin - the difference they can make on a time trial like this is why they started the Giro as the favourites. For smaller guys like me and my team-mate Esteban Chaves, we just hope that the work we did on the time-trial bike in the off-season is enough to minimise the damage and keep us in striking distance of the podium.Simon's one to watch: Chris Froome - will the Team Sky cyclist, looking to become the third rider to win three Grand Tours in a row, be playing catch-up - or extending his race lead?Stage 17: Wednesday, 23 May - Riva del Garda-Iseo, 155km
Simon says: The last chance for the real opportunists. The sprinters and their team-mates will all be fatigued so who will control a stage like this that will surely involve an aggressive start? A breakaway looks certain because all the key teams and riders will be thinking of three incredibly heavy days to come.Simon's one to watch: Luis Leon Sanchez - the Spaniard is a breakaway specialist with all four of his Tour de France stage wins coming in this way.Stage 18: Thursday, 24 May - Abbiategrasso-Pratonevoso, 196km
Simon says: The first of three big days to decide the Giro. I really see two races developing on a stage like today, one for the lucky climbers who make the break and the other between the key General Classification guys on the final and only climb of the day.Simon's one to watch: Carlos Betancur - the Colombian climber is yet to win a Grand Tour stage but has numerous top-10 finishes on mountain stages and to add to his pedigree, he was the best young rider at the Giro in 2013.Stage 19: Friday, 25 May - Venaria Reale-Bardonecchia, 184km
Simon says: This is the hardest day of the race - the Queen stage - and I expect it to be won by a General Classification rider, although you could see big gaps between them. There's a lot of GC players starting the Giro who need to be aggressive and if you have good legs you can really make a difference on a day like today. The break might go to collect King of the Mountain points but I predict it will most likely come back together on the final ascent. Simon's one to watch: Chris Froome - will he be defending the maglia rosa, or needing to attack to take hold of it? This promises to be an exciting day regardless of who is in the lead.Stage 20: Saturday, 26 May - Susa-Cervinnia, 214km
Simon says: The final chance. The General Classification battle will determine how this final stage is raced, but I guarantee it will be action-packed and you will see a lot of key guys marking each other. With only the procession in Rome to follow, our winner will be decided today.This could play into the hands of somebody slightly off the radar on GC for the stage win.Simon's one to watch: George Bennett - the New Zealander is yet to win a Grand Tour stage but comes into the race in decent form having finished fifth in the Tour of the Alps last month.Stage 21: Sunday, 27 May - Rome, 115km
Simon says: Emotions on this day depend on how the previous 20 days have panned out, but there's always a sense of relief. Your body is on the brink of exhaustion and everyone is looking forward to stepping off the bike, having a rest and spending some time with family and loved ones. What an incredible city to finish off our epic three weeks of racing. A short, sharp circuit race in the city of Rome is our last stage. A day for the surviving sprinters who have endured an arduous third week with one eye on victory.Simon's one to watch: Elia Viviani - it's hard to back against the Italian who will be keen to impress in his capital city, particularly if he's not delivered earlier in the race.Everton midfielder Gylfi Sigurdsson will be in Russia - who else will be?With this summer's World Cup in Russia fast approaching, all 32 competing nations are set to name their squads.BBC Sport will bring you the full list as they are named.Gareth Southgate named the England squad on 16 May.

successive promotions and relegate Partick Thistle.In a first half of few chances, Thistle's Blair Spittal had a low strike saved as the Jags tried to overturn their 2-1 first-leg deficit.Keaghan Jacobs' sweeping shot put Livi in front on the day after the break.
And goalkeeper Neil Alexander saved a late Conor Sammon penalty to make sure of victory for David Hopkin's side.Archibald predicts 'changes' at ThistleHopkin to meet Livingston board for talks after promotionPromotions, relegations, demotion & a League Cup - the Livi storyThe Championship runners-up, who won last season's League One title, return to the top flight after a 12-year absence and become the first side since Hamilton Academical in 2014 to win promotion via the Premiership play-off final.
Sammon was denied from the penalty spot on a miserable day for Partick ThistleAlan Archibald's Thistle go back to the second tier five years on from their promotion and just a year after finishing sixth in the top league.The Jags knew all the pressure was on them to get at least one goal without reply just to take the tie to extra-time.The opening 20 minutes were frantic with the home side looking nervous and both Christie Elliott and Adam Barton finding their way into the book of referee John Beaton.Eventually, though, Archibald's side found their way and were able to force a sustained spell of pressure, Chris Erskine's header from a Stevie Lawless cross coming close.Livingston looked content to allow the home side possession until the final third of the pitch before then applying the pressure required to keep their hosts at bay.But with the home side pushing forward gaps began to appear in the Thistle defence.Jordan Thompson had a shot blocked by the legs of Barton and, after a slip by Andrew McCarthy, Livi midfielder Shaun Byrne found himself with space in front of goal but delayed his effort and the chance was gone.
Spittal came closest to scoring for the Jags in the first halfOn the stroke of half-time, Spittal drove forward and fired in an effort from the edge of the box that 40-year-old Alexander dived low to his left to tip the ball around the post.And just 30 seconds into the second period Livingston gave themselves extra breathing space in the tie.Lee Miller flicked on a long throw into the box with the ball falling at the feet of Byrne. The midfielder cushioned the ball into the path of the advancing Jacobs, who drilled his low shot beyond Tomas Cerny.The 2,000-plus fans who had made the short trip along the M8 were now in full voice as they roared their team on.
Jacobs scored his second goal of the tie to put the seal on Livingston's winArchibald soon looked at the bench with Sammon given the nod and McCarthy making way as Thistle looked to find a way back into the tie.Hopkin responded with Thompson replaced with the fresh legs of Nicky Cadden and his trio of central defenders - Craig Halkett, Alan Lithgow and Declan Gallagher - were throwing their bodies in front of anything that came their way.The home side were now committing more and more players forward and both Lawless and Spittal had long-range efforts that ended up in the arms of Alexander, who denied Lawless again moments later.Many of the home fans had already made their way towards the exit before the board showing four additional minutes was raised. But the drama was far from over when the home side were awarded a penalty after a handball by Lithgow.However, Alexander dived to his right to make a terrific stop from Sammon's spot-kick and when referee Beaton blew the full-time whistle it was the Livingston fans who were able to celebrate.The rise, fall and rise again of Livingston1995: Meadowbank Thistle relocated to Livingston and renamed after town2001: Promoted to Scottish Premier League for first time2002: Finish third in top flight, behind Celtic & Rangers, qualify for Uefa Cup2004: Win Scottish League Cup2006: Relegated from top flight2009: Almost liquidated; demoted to old Scottish Third Division (now League Two)2010: Win Third Division title2011: Win Second Division title2015: Avoid relegation from Championship in play-offs2016: Relegated to League One (third tier)2017: Win League One title2018: Finish second in Championship; beat Partick Thistle in play-off finalLine-upsMatch StatsLive TextLine-upsPartick Thistle1Cerny16McGinn13BartonBooked at 31mins4Cargill14ElliottBooked at 4mins37WoodsSubstituted forEdwardsat 70'minutes24McCarthySubstituted forSammonat 55'minutes7Spittal10ErskineSubstituted forBoothat 75'minutes11Lawless9DoolanSubstitutes3Booth12Scully15Devine18Sammon19Edwards21Penrice39StoreyLivingston1Alexander31Gallagher26Halkett4LithgowBooked at 90mins14Jacobs8Pittman6Byrne24ThompsonBooked at 32minsSubstituted forCaddenat 59'minutes3Longridge18MillerSubstituted forMcMillanat 68'minutes17RobinsonSubstituted forBuchananat 79'minutesSubstitutes2McMillan5Buchanan7Mullin11Cadden19Frizzell20MaleyReferee:John BeatonAttendance:7,122Match StatsHome TeamPartick ThistleAway TeamLivingstonPossessionHome66%Away34%ShotsHome8Away5Shots on TargetHome6Away1CornersHome11Away2FoulsHome10Away7Live TextPosted at   Match ends, Partick Thistle 0, Livingston 1.Full TimePosted at 90'+5' Second Half ends, Partick Thistle 0, Livingston 1.Posted at 90'+4' Corner,  Partick Thistle.

The FIA felt Ferrari's mirrors gave them too much aerodynamic gain.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel finished fourth and Kimi Raikkonen retired after 25 laps at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, in a race won by Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton.In future, any team that wants to mount wing mirrors on the halo must do so with only a single mounting, or any secondary one must satisfy two criteria:It must provide a "meaningful structural contribution to the mounting system", which teams may be asked to demonstrate to officialsIt must be "mounted to the lower and/or inboard surface(s) of the mirror housing"Ferrari's secondary mount was above the mirror and formed an outward-leaning curve that had the effect of a small wing, smoothing the airflow rear of the structure.The FIA said it "acknowledged that the rules currently in force with regard to mirrors are not perfect, and will strive to propose a more complete set of rules in terms of mirror position, mountings, visibility, etc. in the near future, with the aim to get a unanimous support for such changes for 2019".The FIA has also been investigating the operation of Ferrari's battery in its role within the hybrid section of the team's power-unit.There are questions over the specifics of the architecture of the system that supplies energy to the MGU-K - the motor that recovers and re-deploys energy on the rear axle.The FIA is seeking an explanation as to how the team's system works, although there has been no official suggestion that Ferrari are doing anything wrong.Keaton Jennings (left) helped Alex Davies put on 175 for the first wicket at Old TraffordRoyal London One-Day Cup, Emirates Old TraffordLancashire 314-7 (50 overs): Davies 147, Jennings 73, Clark 48*; Rimmington 3-64Durham 122 (31.1 overs): Bailey 2-16, Parry 2-20, Mennie 2-24, Parkinson 2-29, Livingstone 2-30Lancashire beat Durham by 192 runsMatch scorecardLancashire opener Alex Davies hit his first one-day century to help his side hammer Durham by 192 runs.After losing their One-Day Cup opener to holders Nottinghamshire on Thursday, the Red Rose responded well, enjoying their biggest runs victory in this competition in 28 years.Davies (147) and Keaton Jennings (73) set the platform for the hosts' 314-7.
Tom Bailey, Stephen Parry, Joe Mennie, Matt Parkinson and Liam Livingstone all took two scalps as Durham made 122.Davies' knock was Lancashire's highest-ever individual score at Old Trafford in one-day cricket - and their best against a fellow first-class county, beating Neil Fairbrother's 145 against Hampshire at Old Trafford in 1990.It is bettered in the county's one-day records only by Australian Andrew Crook's 162 not out against Minor Counties side Buckinghamshire at Wormsley in 2005.Durham, who suffered their second worst defeat in List A cricket, also lost their opening game heavily, by 142 runs to Yorkshire on Friday.Newcastle-born Paul Gustard (centre) won four Premiership titles as a player with LeicesterEngland defence coach Paul Gustard is expected to be named as the new Head of Rugby at Harlequins on Monday.The Premiership side agreed compensation terms with the Rugby Football Union over the weekend.Gustard, who has worked with England boss Eddie Jones since the start of 2016, was contracted to the RFU until after the 2019 Rugby World Cup.
The 42-year-old is understood to be joining Quins after the upcoming tour of South Africa.Inspired to try rugby union?
Find out how to get into rugby union with our special guide.It represents a significant coup for the club, with Gustard one of the most highly rated coaches in the English game.However, it will leave England without a permanent defence and attack coach with the World Cup only 15 months away.While it is believed Gustard leaves England with Jones' blessing, the move is bound to disrupt plans ahead of next year's global showpiece in Japan. Gustard has been one of Jones' most trusted lieutenants over the past two-and-a-half years, helping the side to back-to-back Six Nations titles, as well as series victories away from home against Australia and Argentina.But, despite Harlequins' lamentable 10th-placed Premiership finish this season, the lure of a top domestic job seems to have proved decisive for the former Saracens assistant. England will now need to recruit a replacement for Gustard as a matter of urgency. Wales defence coach Shaun Edwards, who also was interviewed for the Quins job, is believed to be an early front-runner, although he is currently tied to the Welsh Rugby Union until the end of the World Cup. Insight and chat - subscribe to the Rugby Union Weekly podcastSt Helens beat Widnes Vikings in Newcastle on Saturday, one of seven games to be played at this year's Magic WeekendThe Rugby Football League has confirmed that New York is one of the options to host next year's Magic Weekend.The annual Super League event was held for the 12th year this weekend and for the fourth time in a row in Newcastle.The RFL is considering a new host city and, asked if one of them is New York, chief operating officer Ralph Rimmer said: "Yes, we have lots of offers.
"There is plenty of interest in it. Newcastle is a really good venue, but it could well move at some point."The Magic Weekend sees a whole round of Super League fixtures held at the same stadium over the same weekend, Cardiff being the first host in 2007.It has since been staged in Edinburgh and Manchester before moving to Newcastle's St James' Park in 2015, with the highest weekend attendance of 68,276 coming in 2016.Following Toronto Wolfpack's formation in 2017, plans for a New York team have been submitted and England play New Zealand in Denver on 23 June.Newcastle's Magic Weekend generates £4.3m for economyRimmer told 5 live sport during this year's Magic Weekend: "Originally the vision was to put together a property that had some commercial value and also allowed us to spread the gospel, if you like. "We've got some real value in the property so there are plenty of cities - and you'll be surprised at some of them - that contact us saying 'would we contemplate them?'"They would offer some money for it because, in the end, you get a good-natured crowd that have a great time, probably eat and drink their own body weight and create a carnival atmosphere, and any city would want a property like that."It's important that we use it in the right way, we protect the property and use it to project the game forward."That means that, if you do move it, you have to make sure it joins up the dots with what you're trying to achieve strategically."Nadal already held the record for most Italian Open winsRafael Nadal survived a stunning fightback from Alexander Zverev to win a record eighth Italian Open.Nadal cruised to the first set before defending champion Zverev won nine of the next 11 games to take the second set 6-1 and lead 3-1 in the decider.But the Spaniard turned the match around following a lengthy rain delay and closed out a 6-1 1-6 6-3 victory.
The win will see Nadal regain the world number one ranking before the French Open which starts next Sunday.Roger Federer had regained top spot in the rankings when Nadal lost to Dominic Thiem at the Madrid Masters last week, his only defeat on clay this season.Nadal has now won three clay-court titles from four tournaments in the lead-up to his bid for an 11th Roland Garros title in Paris.Svitolina beats Halep in Rome finalMilos Raonic pulls out of French Open with injuryNadal cruised to the first set in just 32 minutes and had looked on course for a routine victory against in-form Zverev, who had won 14 matches in a row and 30 matches in total this season - more than any other player.But the 31-year-old made a number of uncharacteristic errors in the second set while world number three Zverev upped his game to level at 1-1.The German, 21, broke Nadal's serve in the opening game of the deciding set and maintained that break to lead 3-1 going into an 11-minute rain delay.Nadal won the game after the players returned only for play to be halted by a second, longer rain delay, after which he won four games in a row to clinch the match.The win is Nadal's 78th ATP Tour title and takes him clear of John McEnroe into fourth place in the list of most men's titles won in the Open era.It also extends Nadal's impressive record in Rome where he has won the title more than any other player with Serbia's Novak Djokovic second on four titles.Most titles in the Open eraJimmy Connors109Roger Federer97Ivan Lendl94Rafael Nadal78John McEnroe 77AnalysisRussell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondentZverev was just three games away from a first win over Nadal - and a hugely significant one, on clay, so close to the French Open - when rain dragged the players off court.Nadal barely put a foot wrong on the resumption, winning five games in a row to make sure he will be the world number one as well as the top seed at Roland Garros.But make no mistake, Nadal was seriously rattled by the way Zverev played - the German won nine games out of 11 from the start of the second set. Nadal adopted his customary deep returning position, and at times was dominated by the German's big serve and crisp, flat, ball striking.They will be the top two seeds at Roland Garros, and may well meet in the final in Paris. First, though, Zverev must survive the first four rounds, something he is yet to achieve at any Grand Slam.If you were going to play your last round of golf at the age of 93, registering your first hole-in-one during it would be a fitting finale.That was the case for Ohio native Ben Bender at his local course, Green Valley.Armed with his trusty five-wood, the sprightly nonagenarian sent his tee shot over the lake at the 152-yard par-three third hole, and watched with delight as it found the green and trickled into the cup.
A former three handicapper, Ben had played golf for more than 60 years without making an ace.On the day in question he began with an eight at the opening hole and followed that with a seven. But then came the third hole and the chance to write the figure '1' on his scorecard."I'd come close to some hole-in-ones, but this one was level on the green before it curved towards the hole and went in. I was in awe watching it," he said.It proved to be one of the last shots he would strike - as he decided to hang up his clubs that very day.Inspired to try golf?

"It seemed the Lord knew this was my last round so he gave me a hole-in-one."A Green Valley Golf Club employee told BBC Sport: "Physically he was not able to golf anymore."He played on our senior section for years but he will still come to the club to see us."Media playback is not supported on this device
Great Manchester Run: Mo Farah wins first 10km Great Manchester Run
Britain's Olympic and world 10,000m champion Mo Farah said he felt "tired" after his first victory in the 10km Great Manchester Run.Farah, who finished third at the London Marathon last month, raced past Ugandan Moses Kipsiro with 100 metres left to win in 28 minutes 27 seconds.Abel Kirui of Kenya finished third, 25 seconds behind Farah.
Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba won her third straight women's race, well ahead of Kenya's Joyciline Jepkosgei.In the men's wheelchair race, Britain's David Weir beat Johnboy Smith and Simon Lawson to win in 21 minutes 28 seconds. In the women's wheelchair race, Britain's Liz McTernan was victorious in 34 minutes 20 seconds ahead of Heather Gilham and Lucy Keyworth. Watch BBC coverage of the Great Manchester RunFarah, who was appearing in the race for the first time since 2007, took part in a minute's silence before the race in tribute to the 22 people who died in last year's Manchester Arena bombing.For most of the race, the 35-year-old looked comfortable in warm conditions as he kicked past Kipsiro with 100 metres to go.But he said he was still recovering from breaking the British record at last month's marathon - his first event over the distance since switching his focus to road racing."I've got great speed and I know that at the end of the races I can use it if the guys haven't hurt me enough, so today was a matter of hanging in there," he told BBC Sport."I was pretty tired. Having competed in the marathon not so long ago, today was hard work."

Jay Monahan. commissioner of the PGA Tour, says a World Tour is "a possibility"As many of Europe's elite golfers arrive at Wentworth, the boss of the lucrative PGA Tour in the US is suggesting a unified world tour is what the game should be "aspiring to".Speaking to BBC Sport, Jay Monahan, who took over as commissioner of the American circuit last year, believes the game is in "a pretty remarkable time" and that a coming together of rival tours is "a possibility".And the European Tour's £5.2m BMW PGA Championship, which starts on Thursday, illustrates the need for a more coordinated calendar.  
I personally don't love the idea of it. I think golf's done a great job over the last couple of decades of making sure 300 guys who play the game at the very top earn a very good livingEddie Pepperell, world number 100It boasts a strong field but Europe's two highest ranked players - Jon Rahm and Justin Rose - are teeing it up in Texas instead. Rose is absent through no fault of his own and will miss Wentworth as much it misses him.  As a junior he was a regular among the West Course crowds and it is an event that means more than most to him.But PGA Tour rules require their members to compete in an event they have not played over the past four years and, given the pressures of his global schedule, Rose had no viable option other than to put this week's Fort Worth Invitational on his schedule.
Justin Rose first played at the PGA Championship in 2001 when he was just 21 years old but is unable to play this yearFrom the US standpoint, it is a sensible regulation. It means players cannot get too set in their ways and sponsors at slightly lesser events have more chance of attracting marquee names. So Fort Worth gets the Olympic champion as well as Spain's world number four Rahm, when global logic suggests these players should be thrilling European fans instead.Of course, it is an inescapable fact that the PGA Tour calls the shots and other circuits have to bend and adapt accordingly. And this makes Monahan's views on a potential unified global tour all the more fascinating.The commissioner insists he fully respects the European Tour and its chief executive Keith Pelley. "They are partners, we work very closely with Keith and his team," Monahan said."They are also competitors because we are both trying to do the same thing, which is create great championships and maximise playing opportunities for our members."So would that prove easier if the tours were to combine?"Potentially - it depends on how that would come together," Monahan told me. "I certainly think it is something that everybody who is involved in the game should be aspiring to.  "If you look at what's in the best interests of the fan, best interests of the players, you could make the case for one global tour."Monahan accepts any such move would be extremely complicated and is not imminent, but suggested the current climate offered an opportunity.He cites the number of young and established stars in the game and the fact that golf has just returned to the Olympics, with governments across the world investing in it."There's a lot of opportunity that creates," Monahan said. And he sees a coming together as a genuine option. "That is a possibility, absolutely," he said. "Is it going to happen? Only time will tell but we are not going to avoid that conversation - so answering your question, yeah, it's out there."Monahan's opposite number, Pelley, has already acknowledged the prospect of some kind of merger. "Does it make sense to look at it at some point down the road? Perhaps," he said at the end of last year.
European Tour chief Keith Pelley has tried to reinvent the game to attract new fans, with innovations such as first-tee music and a shot clock"If, in fact, it is something that all our players want us to investigate, we would have a fiduciary responsibility to look at it. Would we have conversations with all the other tours? Absolutely. Sure." At face value, the vision for a Formula 1 style global circuit featuring the world's best players competing for massive prize funds at courses close to the planet's most glamorous cities is hard to resist.But for rank and file European Tour members there is less enthusiasm for a World Tour. "I haven't heard much, but I think it is an inevitability, unfortunately," England's world number 100 Eddie Pepperell told The Cut, BBC Golf podcast."I personally don't love the idea of it. I think golf's done a great job over the last couple of decades of making sure 300 guys who play the game at the very top earn a very good living."You can't say that about any other individual sport," he added. Last year each of the top 80 players on the European Tour earned at least £500,000 in prize money."It's always better to have more people earning more money than less people earning even more, and that is what is going to happen if we have a world tour," Pepperell said."I think the European Tour should try as hard as it can to exist on its own two feet. Whether it can or not is a different question."
Eddie Pepperell, ranked at number 100, thinks it is important that the European Tour remains separate so that more players can earn a good livingCertainly, this week the Tour will exude a big time feel. Huge crowds are expected as Rory McIlroy heads a fine field competing on a vastly improved West Course.The luxuriously revamped Wentworth clubhouse provides an opulent backdrop while musically Rudimental and Simple Minds provide the weekend after-round entertainment.But the reality is a landscape evolving rapidly and it will take more than the addition of music to make the most of these changing times.From that point of view, the European Tour has made an inspired signing with Guy Kinnings newly appointed as Pelley's number two. Before his move he had global responsibility for golf with sports management and sponsorship giants IMG and there are few more respected figures in the golf business.  With Monahan acknowledging that talk of a world tour is "out there", Kinnings is joining the European Tour at a pivotal moment.Liverpool were allocated less than 17,000 tickets for the Champions League finalFans seeking tickets for Liverpool's Champions League final against Real Madrid in Ukraine are being asked to pay "ridiculous" prices online.Some are on sale for more than 20 times face value, with one ticket on a resale website priced at more than £14,000.Liverpool sold out their allocation of 16,626 tickets for Saturday's match.
"The situation is ridiculous. Third parties have seen the chance to make a profit," said Reds fan Neil Atkinson, host of the Anfield Wrap podcast.Capacity for the match at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev will be 63,000."A lot of people who don't support either club will end up with tickets and look at it as an opportunity to make money," Atkinson told BBC Sport.Resale website Ticketbis has a range of tickets on offer for the match - with the cheapest in the Real Madrid section at £410 but a lowest price of £1,337 for the Liverpool area.These are tickets in category four, which were available for £61 during the clubs' official ticket sales.The website indicates that several tickets in a neutral section sold for more than £1,200 each.One ticket in category two, where the initial fee was £280, was on sale for £14,723.39.
Tickets being sold online. Category one tickets had a face value of £394, while category two tickets cost £280Liverpool estimate one in three fans were successful in the club's ballot for tickets. They have urged supporters not to buy from touts or travel to the match without tickets.The general resale of football tickets was banned in Britain in 1994 because of safety fears over the possibility of rival fans mingling together.Only outlets officially authorised by clubs are allowed to offer unwanted seats, but overseas firms can avoid UK consumer law.Ticketbis, a subsidiary of Stubhub based in Spain, says in its promotional material that "more than 300,000 clients rely on us for their tickets".A message on its website says it "recently sold" more than 120 Champions League final tickets. Ticketbis and Uefa, European football's governing body, have been approached by the BBC for comment.Other websites selling tickets at inflated prices include Ticketgum, where tickets in category three, sold by the clubs for £140, were priced at more than £1,400.Fans with tickets have faced soaring airfares and inflated hotel charges. Return flights are going for as much as £1,400, while Kiev residents have offered free accommodation for visiting fans after local hotels dramatically increased their prices."Whether it's transport, accommodation or tickets, people are going to exploit the desire of supporters to be there," said Atkinson.Liverpool reached the final with a 7-6 aggregate victory over Roma in the semi-finals.

"Including four players up front was not something we wanted to do," said manager Lopetegui. "We have opted for three other players who had different assets."Spain begin their campaign against Portugal on 15 June in Sochi.Former Real Madrid striker Morata last played for the 2010 world champions in November 2017 when he scored once in a 5-0 win over Costa Rica.Despite his omission from the squad, the striker went on Twitter to wish his countrymen "lots of luck" in the tournament.Morata's Blues team-mates Marcos Alonso and Cesc Fabregas join Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin in also missing out on selection. There is room, however, for Morata's predecessor at Chelsea, with Diego Costa named among the strikers travelling to Russia. Real Madrid and Barcelona supply 10 players between them, with veteran Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta included following his final appearance for the Catalan giants on Sunday. BBC Euro Leagues Football Show analysisJames Horncastle: "While Morata was Lopetegui's guy at under-21 level, you can't begrudge the manager overlooking him when he hasn't really played or lived up to expectations. Iago Aspas and Rodrigo have had good seasons. You get the impression Morata doesn't feel hard done by from his tweet."Julien Laurens: "When you look at Spain's World Cup squad, there was no way Cesc Fabregas deserved to be there.

"On match point, I sucked," the German later said.That was their first meeting. Four subsequent matches have also gone Nadal's way, but there were five sets in the 2017 Australian Open, and a narrow escape for the Spaniard in Sunday's Rome Masters final.
Nadal may well have recovered from 3-1 down in the deciding set without the rain delay, but it certainly checked Zverev's momentum and ended his run of 13 wins in a row.The now 21-year-old, who is based in Monte Carlo, has gathered an impressive array of trophies in a short period of time.  In the past two years, the former junior world number one has won eight titles - including three at Masters level - and been runner-up a further five times.Zverev, who also answers to the name Sascha, has no significant weaknesses. His backhand is breathtakingly good (which is a big advantage on clay when facing Nadal's beloved, and heavily spun, crosscourt forehand), and despite being 6ft 6ins tall, is able to move as well as serve well.Live scores, schedule and resultsBut before the French Open, which begins on Sunday, Zverev still needs to prove himself on the Grand Slam stage. He is yet to reach the quarter-final of any Slam and his one appearance in the fourth round ended in defeat by Milos Raonic at Wimbledon last year.After beating Zverev to the Rome title, Nadal confidently predicted this is just a matter of time.
Zverev's success in Madrid was his third Masters 1000 title (the tier below the Grand Slams) - that's more than any other active player outside of the 'Big Four' of Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray"It's impossible to not have a great result in a Grand Slam when you have the level that he has," the new world number one said. "It's just time. If he's not playing well in Grand Slams during the next two years, you can come back to me and tell me 'you know nothing about tennis'. But I believe that it is going to be a different story."Tennis is tennis. It doesn't matter - best of three, best of five. Playing best of five is a big advantage for the best players, and Sascha is one of the best players."It is hard to argue with Nadal's prediction, although Zverev's Grand Slam performances in the past year have not come close to matching his form on the ATP Tour. He lost to Fernando Verdasco in the first round of last year's French Open, and after that run to the last 16 at Wimbledon, was beaten by Borna Coric in the second round of the US Open.After losing the deciding set of his third-round match 6-0 to eventual semi-finalist Hyeon Chung at January's Australian Open, Zverev said the problem was not physical, but hinted it could be mental.What should be remembered, though, is that the German only turned 21 last month. The French Open will be just the 12th time he has played in a Grand Slam main draw. By means of comparison, Roger Federer's first Slam title, at Wimbledon 2003, came at his 17th attempt. And Federer was about the age then that Zverev will be at the 2019 Australian Open."I try to play the same way, play the same way over a longer period of time," Zverev said, as he looked ahead to Roland Garros after the Rome final."For me, it will be match by match there. And hopefully I'll be able to play the same kind of tennis like I did in the last three weeks. We'll see. The next few days, I will not even think about tennis. And then I'll go to Paris and do my best to prepare and try to compete for the French Open."Of course, Rafa will be the favourite there, there's no question about it. I'll be in the other half of the draw. So, that's a good thing," he said, with a smile.Alexander Zverev factfileBorn:20 April 1997 in Hamburg, GermanyTurned pro:2013Grand Slam appearances:11Best Grand Slam performance:Fourth round, Wimbledon 2017ATP Tour titles:EightATP Tour finals:13Career prize money:£7.73m2018 prize money:£2.44mZverev will arrive in Paris as the world number three, and in the absence of Federer, as the second seed. He knows he will be under the spotlight. He can be prickly and blunt with the media, but he can also be brutally honest."Nerves got the better of me. I choked," he said, after losing a decisive round-robin match to Jack Sock at the ATP Finals in London last November.Zverev has been seeped in tennis for all of his life. His parents, Alexander and Irina, are former professionals, and dad still coaches him to this day. His brother Mischa, nearly 10 years his senior, reached the last eight of the 2017 Australian Open after a stunning win over then world number one Andy Murray.Sascha has been a regular by the side of the court from a toddler as the family travelled with Mischa on the junior tour. He thinks he first had a knock-up with Murray and Novak Djokovic at the age of just three. The man, with the world at his feet, has been a long time in the making.Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone
Does it really have to end? From Roma pulling off one of the greatest shocks in history, to Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon absolutely losing it - it's been an incredible Champions League campaign.Here's how some of the most memorable moments unfolded...
That time Barcelona DIDN'T score There are some results you just don't see coming. This was one of them. The almighty Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw by Olympiakos as they failed to score in a Champions League group stage game for the first time in five (yes, five) years.Luis Suarez had the best chance when he hit the crossbar but was clearly not wearing his shooting boots.
THAT Ronaldo goal"Did you see Ronaldo's goal?" This was probably the most talked about moment in this year's competition in playgrounds, offices and on social media. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo scored an absolutely outrageous overhead bicycle kick against Juventus in their quarter-final first-leg. It was so good even the Juve fans stood up and applauded his skill and audacity. More than 1.2m tweets mentioned Ronaldo's name in the 12 hours following the stunning strike. His peers all seemed to agree the goal was something special, with Manchester United's Marcus Rashford among those reacting on Twitter. 
Perhaps the best reaction, however, was from Real manager, Zinedine Zidane, who encapsulated how many of us were feeling with one dumbstruck facial expression and a disbelieving hand on the head. 
The hyperbole continued for hours after the net had stopped rippling, but former Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa summed it up quite nicely. His tweet roughly translates to: "Ronaldo can now leave earth and play with Martians. He has done everything here."
Liverpool's dismantling of Manchester CityManchester City's team bus wasn't all that was damaged at a hostile Anfield on that Wednesday evening in March. City's pride was a little fragile too after an abundantly confident Liverpool put three past them in their Champions League quarter-final first leg. 
Liverpool have made it all the way to Saturday's final against Real MadridAt one stage, the comeback appeared to be on during the second leg at Etihad Stadium when Gabriel Jesus slotted past Loris Karius within the first two minutes. As it turned out, the drama had only just begun. The home side were denied a penalty and had a goal disallowed for offside, causing manager Pep Guardiola to march on to the pitch in an explosion of fury. The outburst saw him forced to watch the second half from the stands, which gave Liverpool the cue to take full advantage of the dip in energy from the fans and players. Mo Salah's away goal all but secured the victory, Roberto Firmino's second was just twisting the knife. Final aggregate score: Manchester City 1-5 Liverpool. 
Roma stun BarcelonaWell if we thought Liverpool conquering the 'all-conquering Manchester City' was a shock result, we had another think coming...
Kostas Manolas' celebrations summed up the atmosphere at the Stadio OlimpicoRoma were given all but no chance of making it past Guardiola's former side Barcelona, who took a 4-1 lead into the second leg in Rome. However, goals from Edin Dzeko, Daniele de Rossi and Kostas Manolas told us Roma were not ready to accept defeat.  The game finished 3-0 on the night, and 4-4 on aggregate. It was Dzeko's away goal from the first leg that made all the difference.The crowd at the Stadio Olimpico erupted at the final whistle as the Roma substitutes and coaching staff piled on to the pitch to celebrate with the players. There were tears in the stands from those watching, not quite believing what they had witnessed. Roma's social media team also got caught up in the madness.
...and then there was Real Madrid v Juventus Just when we thought we had seen it all, up steps the most dramatic and incident-filled game of the tournament yet.  And who was centre stage? Who do you think? No-one gave Juventus a chance. After all, no team in Champions League history has lost 3-0 at home in the first leg and gone on to wipe out the deficit in the away match.Here's how the madness unfolded:2nd minute: Juventus get the early goal they need when Mario Mandzukic heads home.37th minute: Unbelievable! Mandzukic does it again before half-time. Juventus are now just one goal behind on aggregate.60th minute: They've done it! Somehow Juve are level. Keylor Navas flaps at a cross and Blaise Matuidi bundles the loose ball in. The tie is all-square with 30 minutes remaining.
93rd minute: Drama right at the end. Medhi Benatia's push on Lucas Vazquez is adjudged to be a foul and referee Michael Oliver points to the spot. Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is incensed by the decision and is sent off for dissent.97th minute: With former Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny now in goal, Ronaldo steps to up to stick home the penalty and send Real into the last four.99th minute: Full-time whistle goes. Bedlam. 
All this and we haven't even mentioned Tottenham beating Real Madrid 3-1, despite the Spanish side having double the number of shots on goal as Spurs. Neither have we covered the number of goals scored across the entire competition - a staggering 397 so far - a tournament record. Not to mention the fact Liverpool have broken the record for the most goals scored in a single Champions League season, 46 goals in 14 games including qualifying.  No space either for the Reds' sensational 7-6 semi-final win over Roma.Could Saturday's final provide another moment to add to this list? Watch this space!Whatever happens next with Antonio Conte, Chelsea need to sort out Eden Hazard's future too - and try to convince him to stay at the club.The Belgium forward has got two years left on his contract but he knows that if he wants to leave, he can do.Real Madrid and Manchester City are supposedly interested, and understandably so. He showed again he is a game-changer with his winner in the FA Cup final on Saturday and he is good enough to go wherever he wants to.
When Chelsea won the Premier League under Jose Mourinho in 2015, Hazard was voted the PFA Player of the Year and I felt he had the potential to go on and become the best player in the world.That can still happen. At 27, this is a big World Cup for him and if he wants to showcase his abilities to get a move then he has got the perfect stage, because there is no bigger or better place.He has not been as effective this season for Chelsea as he was last year - but none of the Blues players have been.Hazard was still the one who did something special to beat Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday and now he has a great opportunity to make a real impact in Russia this summer too.
FA Cup: Chelsea need to improve if we are to win more trophies - Eden Hazard
Hazard waiting to see who Chelsea's manager will beI can understand why Hazard is not committing to anything at the moment, because he wants to know what is going on with Chelsea's manager situation first.It looks increasingly likely that Conte will not be in charge of the Blues next season - but, whether he stays or goes, they need to sort it out quickly.If there is going to be a new manager, he can come in and plan - not only for which players are coming in, but also who might be leaving - including Hazard.So, it is a crucial time for Chelsea, and not an easy one.If they want to keep Hazard, they will probably need a manager he wants to play for and they will have to attract him - and any potential signings - without the carrot of Champions League football.In terms of new players, Chelsea have to do better than last summer when they did not get their recruitment right.I have heard a lot of Conte's interviews this season where there have been little digs here and there about the players who came into the club last year, and whether it was with his consent.The players picked up on that and that gave them some sort of excuse for not performing as well as they did when they won the title in his first season in charge.Having said that, if Conte does leave Stamford Bridge in the next few weeks, then he is going as a successful manager with a league title and FA Cup from his two seasons in charge.As I said before Saturday's game, he would love to put the FA Cup on his CV and get one over Jose Mourinho at the same time. He has done both.
Conte: What will happen to the Chelsea manager?
Finishing empty-handed a big blow for MourinhoThe success of Chelsea and United's seasons depended on them winning the FA Cup, so for Mourinho to end the campaign empty-handed is a big blow.Yes, he has taken United from sixth to second place in the Premier League but that football club is all about winning trophies and in style.Mourinho won two in 2016-17 - the Europa League and League Cup - so he will be bitterly disappointed he has not taken any silverware back to Old Trafford this time.'They defended with nine players'
Jose Mourinho won two trophies with Manchester United last season, but none this timeMourinho says Man Utd deserved to win...The way Chelsea kept his side out in the second half at Wembley clearly frustrated him but I would still ask the question why he waited until then to play on the front foot?United were terrible in the first half and offered absolutely nothing. But they were much better after the break, when they started getting behind the Chelsea defence. It was too little, too late.Romelu Lukaku was only fit enough to come on as a substitute with 20 minutes left and, in his absence, Mourinho felt his side lacked a presence in attack.I don't see that as an excuse. They still had plenty of options up front with Alexis Sanchez and Marcus Rashford, as well as Anthony Martial on the bench.They still created some great chances too - in particular Paul Pogba's header when he was unmarked but missed from seven yards out - but I still do not agree with Mourinho's claim that the best side lost.With the way both teams are set up, I always felt that whoever got the first goal was going to go on and win the game, which is how it turned out.
Highlights: Eden Hazard's first-half penalty helps Chelsea beat Man Utd to win FA Cup
United need new players, and a new mindsetUnited do not look like they are anywhere near champions Manchester City, who finished 19 points clear.City's dominance is a worry for all the top teams because of the financial clout Pep Guardiola's side have, and the way they won the title.They are already a long way ahead of the rest and they are going to invest again this summer - I am pretty sure of that - so they are only going to get stronger.United will need to bring some new players in if they are going to get nearer to City, but they also need a new mindset - and their fans will tell you that they need a better brand of football.For some clubs, the way they play is very important. For example, Everton did not sack Sam Allardyce for finishing eighth, they sacked him for the style of football his team plays.United fans want some more flair as well. They have been used to being entertained for so long but some of the football they have seen this season has not done that. It has at times, but not often enough.
When Chelsea won the league title under Conte in 2016-17, they earned 23 more points than they did in 2017-18 while Manchester United picked up 12 more points in Mourinho's second season than they did in his first season in chargeAlan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan at Wembley.                                                                 
FA Cup: I'll respect Chelsea's decision on my future - Antonio Conte
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte delivered a passionate defence of his style and successes while their supporters once more pledged loud allegiance to the Italian - but there was no escaping the sense of finality about this FA Cup victory.Conte's record in two seasons with the Blues is one Premier League title and one FA Cup win - the latter secured by Eden Hazard's first-half penalty at Wembley on Saturday.That record is more than respectable. It is more than most others have managed. Yet it will not, barring a currently unforeseeable and remarkable reversal, be enough to keep the 48-year-old in his job once the dust has settled on another season of uncertainty at Stamford Bridge.
Chelsea's FA Cup win contained characteristics associated with Conte since his arrival in England after a spell in charge of Italy at Euro 2016.As they defended the lead Hazard had given them, the Blues were steely, organised, resilient and victorious. He had done to his adversary, Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho, what the Portuguese has done to so many others - and in a similar style.And yet Conte still faces the same exit as many of his predecessors, including Mourinho, from a club who live so often in a state of flux and yet seem to thrive on it.
Conte: What will happen to the Chelsea manager?
Chelsea's FA Cup win puts a final coat of gloss on a largely disappointing season in which their title defence has been flimsy - with not even a place in the top four to bolster it - and Champions League aspirations were snuffed out by Barcelona at the last-16 stage.Conte remains a hugely popular figure with fans, his name booming out as he bounded up the stairs to join his players as they prepared to lift the trophy.It would be enough for most managers to be able to prepare in security for next season - but not Conte. When the celebrations are finished and he has been allowed to enjoy his win, it seems inevitable his departure will be confirmed.Conte and Chelsea's season has bubbled away on a hob of discontent, the manager cutting a dissatisfied and occasionally disconnected figure, unhappy with his lot.'I'm committed but I can't change'
Conte says he will not alter his approach if he stays at Stamford Bridge...He made it clear here at Wembley that he will not be adapting his style - and history tells us very clearly that Chelsea's hierarchy (and they have a track record of decision-making and successes to support their policy) will not be adopting theirs to suit him.Conte said: "To win in this way, this season, gives me more satisfaction than my wins in the past."The club knows me very well. If they want to continue to work with me, they know me. I can't change."My past is very clear as a player and manager. You can tell what you want - but I'm a serial winner."I showed this in England in a difficult moment for the club, winning the Premier League after finishing in 10th place. I've showed this also today in the FA Cup final because we found the right way to win this trophy."Not quite "back me or sack me" but not far off and the defiance of a winner, someone confident he will always be in demand whether he is at Chelsea or not.

Conte's problem is that for all the glory of this FA Cup final win, there are too many minuses in the ledger, such as the tame end to the season in the wretched defeat at Newcastle United that meant they gave themselves no chance of making a last-ditch bid for the Champions League had Liverpool slipped up at the same time at home to Brighton.Chelsea backed him in the transfer market by paying £65m for Alvaro Morata, £29m for Antonio Rudiger from Roma and £35m for Danny Drinkwater from Leicester City. Davide Zappacosta also arrived from Torino for £25m.However, he has never seemed totally on board with all the moves. Ross Barkley has barely figured since his £15m move from Everton, the midfielder's career now in danger of grinding to a complete halt.And yet, particularly with the flawed sale of Nemanja Matic to Manchester United and the return of Diego Costa to Atletico Madrid - a sale and a deal not helped by Conte's own decision to inform the striker by text he was not in his plans - there has been a sense the manager and those above him have not always been in harmony.It should also be stressed that not all the sympathy in this situation has been reserved for Conte.The manager's body language has not been quite the same this season. There has been a sense of disconnect. He has not been the driven, animated figure in his technical area that he was in that golden first season when he won the title and was only denied a league and FA Cup Double by a Wembley loss to Arsenal.Many of Chelsea's fans may still worship Conte but there is a unique environment at Stamford Bridge.The supporters may not like the idea of him losing his job - but they will still accept it. They have railed at similar decisions before and yet gone along with them because when owner Roman Abramovich has made those changes in the past, success invariably follows in Chelsea's "boom and bust" managerial existence.For now, though - and deservedly - Conte can savour this Wembley success. If it is to be farewell, it is a sweet one.Chelsea's campaign cannot be wholly salvaged by this win because they will not be in the Champions League next season.It can, however, leave the Italian to reflect on a successful two years at Stamford Bridge if the celebrations that come with this victory are to be his final act as manager.Listen: 5 live Football Daily podcastChelsea managers' records since 2004
The Champions League final is almost here and the 2017-18 winner is soon to be crowned.Liverpool and Real Madrid will battle it out for the trophy in Kiev on Saturday, with the Reds looking to stop Zinedine Zidane's side securing a third successive title.But how much can you remember about this season in Europe's elite competition?
Jay Monahan. commissioner of the PGA Tour, says a World Tour is "a possibility"As many of Europe's elite golfers arrive at Wentworth, the boss of the lucrative PGA Tour in the US is suggesting a unified world tour is what the game should be "aspiring to".Speaking to BBC Sport, Jay Monahan, who took over as commissioner of the American circuit last year, believes the game is in "a pretty remarkable time" and that a coming together of rival tours is "a possibility".And the European Tour's £5.2m BMW PGA Championship, which starts on Thursday, illustrates the need for a more coordinated calendar.  
I personally don't love the idea of it. I think golf's done a great job over the last couple of decades of making sure 300 guys who play the game at the very top earn a very good livingEddie Pepperell, world number 100It boasts a strong field but Europe's two highest ranked players - Jon Rahm and Justin Rose - are teeing it up in Texas instead. Rose is absent through no fault of his own and will miss Wentworth as much it misses him.  As a junior he was a regular among the West Course crowds and it is an event that means more than most to him.But PGA Tour rules require their members to compete in an event they have not played over the past four years and, given the pressures of his global schedule, Rose had no viable option other than to put this week's Fort Worth Invitational on his schedule.
Justin Rose first played at the PGA Championship in 2001 when he was just 21 years old but is unable to play this yearFrom the US standpoint, it is a sensible regulation. It means players cannot get too set in their ways and sponsors at slightly lesser events have more chance of attracting marquee names. So Fort Worth gets the Olympic champion as well as Spain's world number four Rahm, when global logic suggests these players should be thrilling European fans instead.Of course, it is an inescapable fact that the PGA Tour calls the shots and other circuits have to bend and adapt accordingly. And this makes Monahan's views on a potential unified global tour all the more fascinating.The commissioner insists he fully respects the European Tour and its chief executive Keith Pelley. "They are partners, we work very closely with Keith and his team," Monahan said."They are also competitors because we are both trying to do the same thing, which is create great championships and maximise playing opportunities for our members."So would that prove easier if the tours were to combine?"Potentially - it depends on how that would come together," Monahan told me. "I certainly think it is something that everybody who is involved in the game should be aspiring to.  "If you look at what's in the best interests of the fan, best interests of the players, you could make the case for one global tour."Monahan accepts any such move would be extremely complicated and is not imminent, but suggested the current climate offered an opportunity.He cites the number of young and established stars in the game and the fact that golf has just returned to the Olympics, with governments across the world investing in it."There's a lot of opportunity that creates," Monahan said. And he sees a coming together as a genuine option. "That is a possibility, absolutely," he said. "Is it going to happen? Only time will tell but we are not going to avoid that conversation - so answering your question, yeah, it's out there."Monahan's opposite number, Pelley, has already acknowledged the prospect of some kind of merger. "Does it make sense to look at it at some point down the road? Perhaps," he said at the end of last year.
European Tour chief Keith Pelley has tried to reinvent the game to attract new fans, with innovations such as first-tee music and a shot clock"If, in fact, it is something that all our players want us to investigate, we would have a fiduciary responsibility to look at it. Would we have conversations with all the other tours? Absolutely. Sure." At face value, the vision for a Formula 1 style global circuit featuring the world's best players competing for massive prize funds at courses close to the planet's most glamorous cities is hard to resist.But for rank and file European Tour members there is less enthusiasm for a World Tour. "I haven't heard much, but I think it is an inevitability, unfortunately," England's world number 100 Eddie Pepperell told The Cut, BBC Golf podcast."I personally don't love the idea of it. I think golf's done a great job over the last couple of decades of making sure 300 guys who play the game at the very top earn a very good living."You can't say that about any other individual sport," he added. Last year each of the top 80 players on the European Tour earned at least £500,000 in prize money."It's always better to have more people earning more money than less people earning even more, and that is what is going to happen if we have a world tour," Pepperell said."I think the European Tour should try as hard as it can to exist on its own two feet. Whether it can or not is a different question."
Eddie Pepperell, ranked at number 100, thinks it is important that the European Tour remains separate so that more players can earn a good livingCertainly, this week the Tour will exude a big time feel. Huge crowds are expected as Rory McIlroy heads a fine field competing on a vastly improved West Course.The luxuriously revamped Wentworth clubhouse provides an opulent backdrop while musically Rudimental and Simple Minds provide the weekend after-round entertainment.But the reality is a landscape evolving rapidly and it will take more than the addition of music to make the most of these changing times.From that point of view, the European Tour has made an inspired signing with Guy Kinnings newly appointed as Pelley's number two. Before his move he had global responsibility for golf with sports management and sponsorship giants IMG and there are few more respected figures in the golf business.  With Monahan acknowledging that talk of a world tour is "out there", Kinnings is joining the European Tour at a pivotal moment.Liverpool were allocated less than 17,000 tickets for the Champions League finalFans seeking tickets for Liverpool's Champions League final against Real Madrid in Ukraine are being asked to pay "ridiculous" prices online.Some are on sale for more than 20 times face value, with one ticket on a resale website priced at more than £14,000.Liverpool sold out their allocation of 16,626 tickets for Saturday's match.
"The situation is ridiculous. Third parties have seen the chance to make a profit," said Reds fan Neil Atkinson, host of the Anfield Wrap podcast.Capacity for the match at the Olympic Stadium in Kiev will be 63,000."A lot of people who don't support either club will end up with tickets and look at it as an opportunity to make money," Atkinson told BBC Sport.Resale website Ticketbis has a range of tickets on offer for the match - with the cheapest in the Real Madrid section at £410 but a lowest price of £1,337 for the Liverpool area.These are tickets in category four, which were available for £61 during the clubs' official ticket sales.The website indicates that several tickets in a neutral section sold for more than £1,200 each.One ticket in category two, where the initial fee was £280, was on sale for £14,723.39.
Tickets being sold online. Category one tickets had a face value of £394, while category two tickets cost £280Liverpool estimate one in three fans were successful in the club's ballot for tickets. They have urged supporters not to buy from touts or travel to the match without tickets.The general resale of football tickets was banned in Britain in 1994 because of safety fears over the possibility of rival fans mingling together.Only outlets officially authorised by clubs are allowed to offer unwanted seats, but overseas firms can avoid UK consumer law.Ticketbis, a subsidiary of Stubhub based in Spain, says in its promotional material that "more than 300,000 clients rely on us for their tickets".A message on its website says it "recently sold" more than 120 Champions League final tickets. Ticketbis and Uefa, European football's governing body, have been approached by the BBC for comment.Other websites selling tickets at inflated prices include Ticketgum, where tickets in category three, sold by the clubs for £140, were priced at more than £1,400.Fans with tickets have faced soaring airfares and inflated hotel charges. Return flights are going for as much as £1,400, while Kiev residents have offered free accommodation for visiting fans after local hotels dramatically increased their prices."Whether it's transport, accommodation or tickets, people are going to exploit the desire of supporters to be there," said Atkinson.Liverpool reached the final with a 7-6 aggregate victory over Roma in the semi-finals.

"Including four players up front was not something we wanted to do," said manager Lopetegui. "We have opted for three other players who had different assets."Spain begin their campaign against Portugal on 15 June in Sochi.Former Real Madrid striker Morata last played for the 2010 world champions in November 2017 when he scored once in a 5-0 win over Costa Rica.Despite his omission from the squad, the striker went on Twitter to wish his countrymen "lots of luck" in the tournament.Morata's Blues team-mates Marcos Alonso and Cesc Fabregas join Arsenal defender Hector Bellerin in also missing out on selection. There is room, however, for Morata's predecessor at Chelsea, with Diego Costa named among the strikers travelling to Russia. Real Madrid and Barcelona supply 10 players between them, with veteran Barca midfielder Andres Iniesta included following his final appearance for the Catalan giants on Sunday. BBC Euro Leagues Football Show analysisJames Horncastle: "While Morata was Lopetegui's guy at under-21 level, you can't begrudge the manager overlooking him when he hasn't really played or lived up to expectations. Iago Aspas and Rodrigo have had good seasons.

"On match point, I sucked," the German later said.That was their first meeting. Four subsequent matches have also gone Nadal's way, but there were five sets in the 2017 Australian Open, and a narrow escape for the Spaniard in Sunday's Rome Masters final.
Nadal may well have recovered from 3-1 down in the deciding set without the rain delay, but it certainly checked Zverev's momentum and ended his run of 13 wins in a row.The now 21-year-old, who is based in Monte Carlo, has gathered an impressive array of trophies in a short period of time.  In the past two years, the former junior world number one has won eight titles - including three at Masters level - and been runner-up a further five times.Zverev, who also answers to the name Sascha, has no significant weaknesses. His backhand is breathtakingly good (which is a big advantage on clay when facing Nadal's beloved, and heavily spun, crosscourt forehand), and despite being 6ft 6ins tall, is able to move as well as serve well.Live scores, schedule and resultsBut before the French Open, which begins on Sunday, Zverev still needs to prove himself on the Grand Slam stage. He is yet to reach the quarter-final of any Slam and his one appearance in the fourth round ended in defeat by Milos Raonic at Wimbledon last year.After beating Zverev to the Rome title, Nadal confidently predicted this is just a matter of time.
Zverev's success in Madrid was his third Masters 1000 title (the tier below the Grand Slams) - that's more than any other active player outside of the 'Big Four' of Nadal, Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray"It's impossible to not have a great result in a Grand Slam when you have the level that he has," the new world number one said. "It's just time. If he's not playing well in Grand Slams during the next two years, you can come back to me and tell me 'you know nothing about tennis'. But I believe that it is going to be a different story."Tennis is tennis. It doesn't matter - best of three, best of five. Playing best of five is a big advantage for the best players, and Sascha is one of the best players."It is hard to argue with Nadal's prediction, although Zverev's Grand Slam performances in the past year have not come close to matching his form on the ATP Tour. He lost to Fernando Verdasco in the first round of last year's French Open, and after that run to the last 16 at Wimbledon, was beaten by Borna Coric in the second round of the US Open.After losing the deciding set of his third-round match 6-0 to eventual semi-finalist Hyeon Chung at January's Australian Open, Zverev said the problem was not physical, but hinted it could be mental.What should be remembered, though, is that the German only turned 21 last month. The French Open will be just the 12th time he has played in a Grand Slam main draw. By means of comparison, Roger Federer's first Slam title, at Wimbledon 2003, came at his 17th attempt. And Federer was about the age then that Zverev will be at the 2019 Australian Open."I try to play the same way, play the same way over a longer period of time," Zverev said, as he looked ahead to Roland Garros after the Rome final."For me, it will be match by match there. And hopefully I'll be able to play the same kind of tennis like I did in the last three weeks. We'll see. The next few days, I will not even think about tennis. And then I'll go to Paris and do my best to prepare and try to compete for the French Open."Of course, Rafa will be the favourite there, there's no question about it. I'll be in the other half of the draw. So, that's a good thing," he said, with a smile.Alexander Zverev factfileBorn:20 April 1997 in Hamburg, GermanyTurned pro:2013Grand Slam appearances:11Best Grand Slam performance:Fourth round, Wimbledon 2017ATP Tour titles:EightATP Tour finals:13Career prize money:£7.73m2018 prize money:£2.44mZverev will arrive in Paris as the world number three, and in the absence of Federer, as the second seed. He knows he will be under the spotlight. He can be prickly and blunt with the media, but he can also be brutally honest."Nerves got the better of me. I choked," he said, after losing a decisive round-robin match to Jack Sock at the ATP Finals in London last November.Zverev has been seeped in tennis for all of his life. His parents, Alexander and Irina, are former professionals, and dad still coaches him to this day. His brother Mischa, nearly 10 years his senior, reached the last eight of the 2017 Australian Open after a stunning win over then world number one Andy Murray.Sascha has been a regular by the side of the court from a toddler as the family travelled with Mischa on the junior tour. He thinks he first had a knock-up with Murray and Novak Djokovic at the age of just three. The man, with the world at his feet, has been a long time in the making.Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phoneDoes it really have to end? From Roma pulling off one of the greatest shocks in history, to Italy legend Gianluigi Buffon absolutely losing it - it's been an incredible Champions League campaign.Here's how some of the most memorable moments unfolded...
That time Barcelona DIDN'T score There are some results you just don't see coming. This was one of them. The almighty Barcelona were held to a 0-0 draw by Olympiakos as they failed to score in a Champions League group stage game for the first time in five (yes, five) years.Luis Suarez had the best chance when he hit the crossbar but was clearly not wearing his shooting boots.
THAT Ronaldo goal"Did you see Ronaldo's goal?" This was probably the most talked about moment in this year's competition in playgrounds, offices and on social media. Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo scored an absolutely outrageous overhead bicycle kick against Juventus in their quarter-final first-leg. It was so good even the Juve fans stood up and applauded his skill and audacity. More than 1.2m tweets mentioned Ronaldo's name in the 12 hours following the stunning strike. His peers all seemed to agree the goal was something special, with Manchester United's Marcus Rashford among those reacting on Twitter. 
Perhaps the best reaction, however, was from Real manager, Zinedine Zidane, who encapsulated how many of us were feeling with one dumbstruck facial expression and a disbelieving hand on the head. 
The hyperbole continued for hours after the net had stopped rippling, but former Real defender Alvaro Arbeloa summed it up quite nicely. His tweet roughly translates to: "Ronaldo can now leave earth and play with Martians. He has done everything here."
Liverpool's dismantling of Manchester CityManchester City's team bus wasn't all that was damaged at a hostile Anfield on that Wednesday evening in March. City's pride was a little fragile too after an abundantly confident Liverpool put three past them in their Champions League quarter-final first leg. 
Liverpool have made it all the way to Saturday's final against Real MadridAt one stage, the comeback appeared to be on during the second leg at Etihad Stadium when Gabriel Jesus slotted past Loris Karius within the first two minutes. As it turned out, the drama had only just begun. The home side were denied a penalty and had a goal disallowed for offside, causing manager Pep Guardiola to march on to the pitch in an explosion of fury. The outburst saw him forced to watch the second half from the stands, which gave Liverpool the cue to take full advantage of the dip in energy from the fans and players. Mo Salah's away goal all but secured the victory, Roberto Firmino's second was just twisting the knife. Final aggregate score: Manchester City 1-5 Liverpool. 
Roma stun BarcelonaWell if we thought Liverpool conquering the 'all-conquering Manchester City' was a shock result, we had another think coming...
Kostas Manolas' celebrations summed up the atmosphere at the Stadio OlimpicoRoma were given all but no chance of making it past Guardiola's former side Barcelona, who took a 4-1 lead into the second leg in Rome. However, goals from Edin Dzeko, Daniele de Rossi and Kostas Manolas told us Roma were not ready to accept defeat.  The game finished 3-0 on the night, and 4-4 on aggregate. It was Dzeko's away goal from the first leg that made all the difference.The crowd at the Stadio Olimpico erupted at the final whistle as the Roma substitutes and coaching staff piled on to the pitch to celebrate with the players. There were tears in the stands from those watching, not quite believing what they had witnessed. Roma's social media team also got caught up in the madness.
...and then there was Real Madrid v Juventus Just when we thought we had seen it all, up steps the most dramatic and incident-filled game of the tournament yet.  And who was centre stage? Who do you think? No-one gave Juventus a chance. After all, no team in Champions League history has lost 3-0 at home in the first leg and gone on to wipe out the deficit in the away match.Here's how the madness unfolded:2nd minute: Juventus get the early goal they need when Mario Mandzukic heads home.37th minute: Unbelievable! Mandzukic does it again before half-time. Juventus are now just one goal behind on aggregate.60th minute: They've done it! Somehow Juve are level. Keylor Navas flaps at a cross and Blaise Matuidi bundles the loose ball in. The tie is all-square with 30 minutes remaining.
93rd minute: Drama right at the end. Medhi Benatia's push on Lucas Vazquez is adjudged to be a foul and referee Michael Oliver points to the spot. Juventus goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon is incensed by the decision and is sent off for dissent.97th minute: With former Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny now in goal, Ronaldo steps to up to stick home the penalty and send Real into the last four.99th minute: Full-time whistle goes. Bedlam. 
All this and we haven't even mentioned Tottenham beating Real Madrid 3-1, despite the Spanish side having double the number of shots on goal as Spurs. Neither have we covered the number of goals scored across the entire competition - a staggering 397 so far - a tournament record. Not to mention the fact Liverpool have broken the record for the most goals scored in a single Champions League season, 46 goals in 14 games including qualifying.  No space either for the Reds' sensational 7-6 semi-final win over Roma.Could Saturday's final provide another moment to add to this list? Watch this space!Whatever happens next with Antonio Conte, Chelsea need to sort out Eden Hazard's future too - and try to convince him to stay at the club.The Belgium forward has got two years left on his contract but he knows that if he wants to leave, he can do.Real Madrid and Manchester City are supposedly interested, and understandably so. He showed again he is a game-changer with his winner in the FA Cup final on Saturday and he is good enough to go wherever he wants to.
When Chelsea won the Premier League under Jose Mourinho in 2015, Hazard was voted the PFA Player of the Year and I felt he had the potential to go on and become the best player in the world.That can still happen. At 27, this is a big World Cup for him and if he wants to showcase his abilities to get a move then he has got the perfect stage, because there is no bigger or better place.He has not been as effective this season for Chelsea as he was last year - but none of the Blues players have been.Hazard was still the one who did something special to beat Manchester United at Wembley on Saturday and now he has a great opportunity to make a real impact in Russia this summer too.
FA Cup: Chelsea need to improve if we are to win more trophies - Eden Hazard
Hazard waiting to see who Chelsea's manager will beI can understand why Hazard is not committing to anything at the moment, because he wants to know what is going on with Chelsea's manager situation first.It looks increasingly likely that Conte will not be in charge of the Blues next season - but, whether he stays or goes, they need to sort it out quickly.If there is going to be a new manager, he can come in and plan - not only for which players are coming in, but also who might be leaving - including Hazard.So, it is a crucial time for Chelsea, and not an easy one.If they want to keep Hazard, they will probably need a manager he wants to play for and they will have to attract him - and any potential signings - without the carrot of Champions League football.In terms of new players, Chelsea have to do better than last summer when they did not get their recruitment right.I have heard a lot of Conte's interviews this season where there have been little digs here and there about the players who came into the club last year, and whether it was with his consent.The players picked up on that and that gave them some sort of excuse for not performing as well as they did when they won the title in his first season in charge.Having said that, if Conte does leave Stamford Bridge in the next few weeks, then he is going as a successful manager with a league title and FA Cup from his two seasons in charge.As I said before Saturday's game, he would love to put the FA Cup on his CV and get one over Jose Mourinho at the same time. He has done both.
Conte: What will happen to the Chelsea manager?
Finishing empty-handed a big blow for MourinhoThe success of Chelsea and United's seasons depended on them winning the FA Cup, so for Mourinho to end the campaign empty-handed is a big blow.Yes, he has taken United from sixth to second place in the Premier League but that football club is all about winning trophies and in style.Mourinho won two in 2016-17 - the Europa League and League Cup - so he will be bitterly disappointed he has not taken any silverware back to Old Trafford this time.'They defended with nine players'
Jose Mourinho won two trophies with Manchester United last season, but none this timeMourinho says Man Utd deserved to win...The way Chelsea kept his side out in the second half at Wembley clearly frustrated him but I would still ask the question why he waited until then to play on the front foot?United were terrible in the first half and offered absolutely nothing. But they were much better after the break, when they started getting behind the Chelsea defence. It was too little, too late.Romelu Lukaku was only fit enough to come on as a substitute with 20 minutes left and, in his absence, Mourinho felt his side lacked a presence in attack.I don't see that as an excuse. They still had plenty of options up front with Alexis Sanchez and Marcus Rashford, as well as Anthony Martial on the bench.They still created some great chances too - in particular Paul Pogba's header when he was unmarked but missed from seven yards out - but I still do not agree with Mourinho's claim that the best side lost.With the way both teams are set up, I always felt that whoever got the first goal was going to go on and win the game, which is how it turned out.
Highlights: Eden Hazard's first-half penalty helps Chelsea beat Man Utd to win FA Cup
United need new players, and a new mindsetUnited do not look like they are anywhere near champions Manchester City, who finished 19 points clear.City's dominance is a worry for all the top teams because of the financial clout Pep Guardiola's side have, and the way they won the title.They are already a long way ahead of the rest and they are going to invest again this summer - I am pretty sure of that - so they are only going to get stronger.United will need to bring some new players in if they are going to get nearer to City, but they also need a new mindset - and their fans will tell you that they need a better brand of football.For some clubs, the way they play is very important. For example, Everton did not sack Sam Allardyce for finishing eighth, they sacked him for the style of football his team plays.United fans want some more flair as well. They have been used to being entertained for so long but some of the football they have seen this season has not done that. It has at times, but not often enough.
When Chelsea won the league title under Conte in 2016-17, they earned 23 more points than they did in 2017-18 while Manchester United picked up 12 more points in Mourinho's second season than they did in his first season in chargeAlan Shearer was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan at Wembley.Williams have finished in the points just once this seasonIt's no secret the Williams team are struggling - we've seen it at every grand prix this season.Five races into 2018 they sit bottom of the constructors' championship, their car clearly uncompetitive.They have been here before, having failed to finish higher than eighth for three seasons between 2011 and 2013.
But what is worrying on this occasion is that the team's hierarchy is struggling to see a stable future without significant changes being implemented. Speaking last month, deputy team principal Claire Williams claimed F1 was "basically broken" because of financial discrepancies between the top teams and the rest, and called for the sport's owners Liberty Media to approve a budget cap currently under consideration. So how did it come to this for one of the sport's most famous and enduring names? Don't forget to cast your vote on whether F1 should introduce a budget cap at the bottom of this article.From leaders to feedersFrank Williams set up his eponymous Williams Grand Prix Engineering operation in 1977 and success was quick to follow thanks to the design nous of Patrick Head, the bullish driving of Australia's Alan Jones and the pace and durability of the Cosworth DFV engine.The team's maiden world title followed arrived in 1980 - Jones delivering on his early promise - before Keke Rosberg (1982), Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992), Alain Prost (1993), Damon Hill (1996) and Jacques Villeneuve (1997) followed suit.The team's success in the 1980s and 1990s - which came amid fierce duels with McLaren and Ferrari - delivered them nine constructors' championships, a record second only to Ferrari's 16.Williams' innovative engine and technical partnerships with Honda and Renault were key to their competitiveness, which in turn allowed them to compete for the best drivers and designers. But as costs soared during the 2000s, the team trickled down the order, their place at the sharp end of the grid no longer assured as the likes of McLaren - bolstered by Mercedes backing - and Ferrari grew ever stronger thanks to the support of their road car divisions. Williams, as a privateer, had no such backing, and it quickly took a toll on results.Perhaps this is best demonstrated by the fact that Williams' 113th grand prix win came in 2004 and their 114th in 2012. They are still awaiting win number 115.
Analysis Andrew Benson - chief F1 writerWilliams are last in the constructors' championship after five races this year, and in grave danger of finishing there if they cannot turn their season around quickly.Last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix highlighted their problems - a difficult, slow car and inexperienced drivers meant lots of mistakes, qualifying at the back and zero points.The team know what is wrong. The car has a fundamental aerodynamic flaw - the rear floor suffers an aerodynamic stall on corner entry, making it unpredictable to drive. New parts to fix the problems are on their way but are not expected until just before the summer break - at the halfway point of the season.These are worrying times for a once great team. They have two unconvincing 'pay' drivers in the car, making it more difficult to be sure of the car's actual level.As for the future, with performance as bad as this, what proven, well-rated driver would want to go there? 
Claire Williams took over day-to-day running of the team from father Frank in 2013'Surviving, not racing'Williams now have the youngest drivers on the grid with 19-year-old Lance Stroll and the 22-year-old Russian Sergey Sirotkin. Both have struggled this season with their best result Stroll's eighth in Azerbaijan.Stroll says the team are "surviving, not racing" and he was struggling with balance issues throughout all five races this season, adding: "The car wasn't cooperating the way I wanted it to, the balance was all over the place."Sirotkin, meanwhile, said the seat in his car was "so painful" he struggled to make it through the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona last time out. 
So what's next?The team want a level playing field when it comes to budgets, with Claire Williams admitting she was ready to "crack open some champagne" after Liberty Media said it would consider proposals for a $150m spending cap by 2021.Such a move is unlikely to appeal greatly to teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari, who spend around three times that figure, but Claire Williams is blunt about the cost of inaction."If we don't do this then Williams will close the whole of the company," she said recently."Sometimes you almost need to hit rock bottom to make you address the areas that you may have papered over previously."For the sake of one of the sport's greatest teams, let's hope they do not have any further to fall.

Talent and performance followed into the noughties with drivers such as Juan Pablo Montoya, but by then costs were beginning to really ramp upBernd Stange faced Fabio Capello's England in 2009 while working as Belarus coachFrom Saddam Hussein to Bashar al-Assad. From bullets being fired at his bodyguard to witnessing sites of suspected chemical attacks.Bernd Stange is evidently not a man who believes in an easy life.A former coach of Iraq, the 70-year-old German has signed a contract to lead Syria until the 2019 Asian Cup.
But what motivates him to work in a country where, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, more than 400,000 people have been killed or reported missing over seven years of war?"I believe we should bring back a smile to Syrian people who have suffered for such a long time," he told the BBC's World Football programme. "They love football."But, for a man who spends half of his time in capital city Damascus, there are psychological challenges that come with life in a war zone."I saw destroyed Ghouta and Douma," he said, referring to the sites of suspected chemical attacks."Sometimes you hear what you think is lightning but it's bombing."I will not say it is normal life. If you are travelling to Aleppo, to Homs, and you see what's happened there, left and right of the street, you cannot speak for a while and you are deeply depressed."It's such an old country, and Damascus is a wonderful city. If you feel how long it will take to clean up the country and to bring back normal life, maybe it will take one generation."'They sang my name - my heart was broken'For some, the Syrian national team is a representative of Assad's brutal crackdown against rebellion.Stange is yet to meet the Syrian president but said: "If I have the chance to see him, of course I will go."The football federation is run independently by only a few people, and it's not involved in any politics. I can take my own decisions, it's part of my contract."Stange also never met former president Saddam Hussein while coaching Iraq, a job he held for two years from 2002. Nevertheless, he was referred to as 'Saddam's Coach' in his homeland, and heavily criticised."I coached the national team of Iraq before the war, and I was blamed for that, especially by Western media," he said."I coached the same national team three weeks after the war, when everything was destroyed, and from this moment I achieved so many awards for doing the same job: coaching a football team to put the ball in the net."A day before the US-led invasion that finally toppled Saddam in 2003, Stange left Iraq on the orders of the German embassy."I went back one week after the war with the idea to tell them face to face that I will not continue my contract," he said."When I arrived at the hotel, I saw the players and their families, and the whole football federation. They were waiting for me and singing my name: 'Captain Stange is back, is back.'"My heart was broken and, being honest, I was not able to tell them: 'I will let you down.'"
Bernd Stange took his Iraq squad to Germany in 2003Bush, Blair - and a fateful photograph with Jack StrawHaving changed his mind, Stange began to build a team that almost secured an Olympic medal in Athens in 2004, and went on to win the 2007 Asian Cup."Everything was destroyed, we didn't even have any balls, we had absolutely nothing," he said."We were training using sandbags. We had no warm water, we could not practise in the evenings because of attacks."I tried to take the team out of this horrible Baghdad at the time and I needed support. We needed money for flight tickets; we needed visas."Stange sought help from world leaders including former United States president George W Bush, then British Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex-Italy Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi."I wrote letters to to help us to build football," he said."I still have the letter that Tony Blair wrote to me."That led to a brief tour of England in 2004."The Football Association managed hotels and games for us and they provided us with 5,000 balls," said Stange.But a photoshoot with then Foreign Secretary Jack Straw ultimately prompted his departure from the team just weeks before the 2004 Olympics."There was a photo in the garden of the parliament and half the team didn't want to be in it," he said."They said, 'maybe we will be blamed by terrorists or other people, that we take presents from mortal enemies'."But I thought it was very important to bring Iraqis to London and to play football there, to show that we are out of politics."Unfortunately I got threats after this trip and very bad letters, and my bodyguard had a bullet in his car."I decided to finish because it was too dangerous."Stange returned to Iraq in March, when Syria played in a friendly tournament in Basra, nine months after the return of international football to Iraq.What he saw gave him hope for the future of Syrian football."If you see the capacity crowd - 65,000 cheering people - if you see in the neighbourhood a stadium showing a public viewing with 10,000 people watching, then you can feel how happy they are to have their most-loved sport back in their country."Hopefully it will be soon for the Syrian people, to play matches in Aleppo and Damascus."Stange's travels - his managerial career1982-1988: East GermanyJuly 1989-May 1991: Carl Zeiss Jena (East Germany)July 1991-August 1992: Hertha Berlin (Germany)August 1994-March 1995: Hertha Berlin (Germany)April 1995-June 1995: Dnipro (Ukraine)July 1996: CSKA Kiev (Ukraine)July 1998-December 2000: Perth Glory (Australia)June 2001-September 2001: OmanNovember 2002-June 2004: IraqJanuary 2005-January 2007: Apollon Limassol (Cyprus)July 2007-November 2011: BelarusMay 2013-April 2016: SingaporeFebruary 2018-: SyriaAlso on this week's World Football, Spain striker David Villa gives us his World Cup memories.So the Champions League is almost over for the season - with just Saturday's final between Real Madrid and Liverpool in Kiev to come.We have compiled a shortlist of some of this season's best performers, including a couple of players who have not featured since the group stages.Pick your best XI below - don't forget you can change the formation - and share it with your friends using #bbcfootball.

Monday, 21 May - rest daySimon says: After a long transfer we will normally sleep in as long as possible. We'll take a look at stage 16's individual time trial course in the morning but rest is just as, if not more, important. So, after we have ridden over what is a reasonably straightforward TT we will retreat to the team hotel and just lay low and focus on what surely will be one of the most crucial show downs of the entire Giro.Stage 16: Tuesday, 22 May - Individual time trial, Trento-Rovereto, 34.2km
Simon says: Survival day. Before the race even started we knew today was our danger day. Days like today are made for Chris Froome and Tom Dumoulin - the difference they can make on a time trial like this is why they started the Giro as the favourites. For smaller guys like me and my team-mate Esteban Chaves, we just hope that the work we did on the time-trial bike in the off-season is enough to minimise the damage and keep us in striking distance of the podium.Simon's one to watch: Chris Froome - the Team Sky cyclist, looking to become the third rider to win three Grand Tours in a row, is playing catch-up...Stage 17: Wednesday, 23 May - Riva del Garda-Iseo, 155km
Simon says: The last chance for the real opportunists. The sprinters and their team-mates will all be fatigued so who will control a stage like this that will surely involve an aggressive start? A breakaway looks certain because all the key teams and riders will be thinking of three incredibly heavy days to come.Simon's one to watch: Luis Leon Sanchez - the Spaniard is a breakaway specialist with all four of his Tour de France stage wins coming in this way.Stage 18: Thursday, 24 May - Abbiategrasso-Pratonevoso, 196km
Simon says: The first of three big days to decide the Giro. I really see two races developing on a stage like today, one for the lucky climbers who make the break and the other between the key General Classification guys on the final and only climb of the day.Simon's one to watch: Carlos Betancur - the Colombian climber is yet to win a Grand Tour stage but has numerous top-10 finishes on mountain stages and to add to his pedigree, he was the best young rider at the Giro in 2013.Stage 19: Friday, 25 May - Venaria Reale-Bardonecchia, 184km
Simon says: This is the hardest day of the race - the Queen stage - and I expect it to be won by a General Classification rider, although you could see big gaps between them. There's a lot of GC players starting the Giro who need to be aggressive and if you have good legs you can really make a difference on a day like today. The break might go to collect King of the Mountain points but I predict it will most likely come back together on the final ascent. Simon's one to watch: Chris Froome - will he be needing to attack? This promises to be an exciting day regardless of who is in the lead.Stage 20: Saturday, 26 May - Susa-Cervinnia, 214km
Simon says: The final chance. The General Classification battle will determine how this final stage is raced, but I guarantee it will be action-packed and you will see a lot of key guys marking each other. With only the procession in Rome to follow, our winner will be decided today.This could play into the hands of somebody slightly off the radar on GC for the stage win.Simon's one to watch: George Bennett - the New Zealander is yet to win a Grand Tour stage but comes into the race in decent form having finished fifth in the Tour of the Alps last month.Stage 21: Sunday, 27 May - Rome, 115km
Simon says: Emotions on this day depend on how the previous 20 days have panned out, but there's always a sense of relief. Your body is on the brink of exhaustion and everyone is looking forward to stepping off the bike, having a rest and spending some time with family and loved ones. What an incredible city to finish off our epic three weeks of racing. A short, sharp circuit race in the city of Rome is our last stage. A day for the surviving sprinters who have endured an arduous third week with one eye on victory.Simon's one to watch: Elia Viviani - it's hard to back against the Italian who will be keen to impress in his capital city.A selection of some of the most striking sports photographs taken around the world this week:

He succeeds David Moyes, who was released at the end of his contract after guiding the Hammers to a 13th place finish.Chilean Pellegrini will be joined at London Stadium by assistant Ruben Cousillas.West Ham had explored the possibility of hiring Newcastle United manager Rafael Benitez but quickly concluded it would be hugely difficult for the Spaniard to leave St James' Park.Pellegrini, who was on a huge contract in China, has agreed to take a pay cut but it is anticipated he will become the highest paid manager in West Ham's history.Chairman David Sullivan had previously said he intended to hire someone who had experience at the highest level.He will hope Pellegrini, who won the 2013-14 Premier League title and two EFL Cups during his three years at Manchester City, in addition to qualifying the club for the Champions League semi-finals for the only time in their history, can bring some stability to West Ham.The club have experienced huge problems during their first two seasons after leaving their legendary home at Upton Park.Manuel Pellegrini's Premier League recordClubSeasonWin %Points per gameMan City2013-1471.1%2.26Man City2014-1563.2%2.08Man City2015-1650.0%1.74Williams have finished in the points just once this seasonIt's no secret the Williams team are struggling - we've seen it at every grand prix this season.Five races into 2018 they sit bottom of the constructors' championship, their car clearly uncompetitive.They have been here before, having failed to finish higher than eighth for three seasons between 2011 and 2013.
But what is worrying on this occasion is that the team's hierarchy is struggling to see a stable future without significant changes being implemented. Speaking last month, deputy team principal Claire Williams claimed F1 was "basically broken" because of financial discrepancies between the top teams and the rest, and called for the sport's owners Liberty Media to approve a budget cap currently under consideration. So how did it come to this for one of the sport's most famous and enduring names? Don't forget to cast your vote on whether F1 should introduce a budget cap at the bottom of this article.From leaders to feedersFrank Williams set up his eponymous Williams Grand Prix Engineering operation in 1977 and success was quick to follow thanks to the design nous of Patrick Head, the bullish driving of Australia's Alan Jones and the pace and durability of the Cosworth DFV engine.The team's maiden world title followed arrived in 1980 - Jones delivering on his early promise - before Keke Rosberg (1982), Nelson Piquet (1987), Nigel Mansell (1992), Alain Prost (1993), Damon Hill (1996) and Jacques Villeneuve (1997) followed suit.The team's success in the 1980s and 1990s - which came amid fierce duels with McLaren and Ferrari - delivered them nine constructors' championships, a record second only to Ferrari's 16.Williams' innovative engine and technical partnerships with Honda and Renault were key to their competitiveness, which in turn allowed them to compete for the best drivers and designers. But as costs soared during the 2000s, the team trickled down the order, their place at the sharp end of the grid no longer assured as the likes of McLaren - bolstered by Mercedes backing - and Ferrari grew ever stronger thanks to the support of their road car divisions. Williams, as a privateer, had no such backing, and it quickly took a toll on results.Perhaps this is best demonstrated by the fact that Williams' 113th grand prix win came in 2004 and their 114th in 2012. They are still awaiting win number 115.
Analysis Andrew Benson - chief F1 writerWilliams are last in the constructors' championship after five races this year, and in grave danger of finishing there if they cannot turn their season around quickly.Last weekend's Spanish Grand Prix highlighted their problems - a difficult, slow car and inexperienced drivers meant lots of mistakes, qualifying at the back and zero points.The team know what is wrong. The car has a fundamental aerodynamic flaw - the rear floor suffers an aerodynamic stall on corner entry, making it unpredictable to drive. New parts to fix the problems are on their way but are not expected until just before the summer break - at the halfway point of the season.These are worrying times for a once great team. They have two unconvincing 'pay' drivers in the car, making it more difficult to be sure of the car's actual level.As for the future, with performance as bad as this, what proven, well-rated driver would want to go there? 
Claire Williams took over day-to-day running of the team from father Frank in 2013'Surviving, not racing'Williams now have the youngest drivers on the grid with 19-year-old Lance Stroll and the 22-year-old Russian Sergey Sirotkin. Both have struggled this season with their best result Stroll's eighth in Azerbaijan.Stroll says the team are "surviving, not racing" and he was struggling with balance issues throughout all five races this season, adding: "The car wasn't cooperating the way I wanted it to, the balance was all over the place."Sirotkin, meanwhile, said the seat in his car was "so painful" he struggled to make it through the Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona last time out. 
So what's next?The team want a level playing field when it comes to budgets, with Claire Williams admitting she was ready to "crack open some champagne" after Liberty Media said it would consider proposals for a $150m spending cap by 2021.Such a move is unlikely to appeal greatly to teams such as Mercedes and Ferrari, who spend around three times that figure, but Claire Williams is blunt about the cost of inaction."If we don't do this then Williams will close the whole of the company," she said recently."Sometimes you almost need to hit rock bottom to make you address the areas that you may have papered over previously."For the sake of one of the sport's greatest teams, let's hope they do not have any further to fall.

The first Test against Pakistan is England's first since Ed Smith (left) was appointed national selectorEngland v Pakistan, first TestDate: 24-28 May Time: 11:00 BST Venue: Lord'sCoverage: Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 LW and the BBC Sport website. Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Full tour detailsEngland stand on the eve of a really important summer.They will want to continue their excellent progress towards a home World Cup next year, and in Test cricket they have to find a team that can both win at home and compete away - beginning with the first match against Pakistan at Lord's on Thursday.After a bruising winter - coming a distant second best in the Ashes and then more disappointment in New Zealand - England not only have to win, but also find a way to develop into a more rounded, all-conditions outfit.
That is a tricky task, especially given the relentless nature of their schedule. Trips to the uncomfortable surroundings (in cricketing terms) of Sri Lanka and the West Indies follow this winter, with the chance to win back the Ashes from Australia in 2019.Not only that, but there are question marks over some of the senior players because of form or longevity.There is a lot that captain Joe Root, coach Trevor Bayliss and new national selector Ed Smith have to work out in a relatively short space of time.I will play without pressure - Bess on possible Test debutListen again: Tuffers & Vaughan Cricket ShowEngland's preparation is not good enoughWe have been speaking about the same subject for two or three years, maybe longer. If you look at England's preparation for Test cricket, home or away, it is not good enough.They are not getting enough good quality experience of conditions when they are on tour and, even though at home they can say, 'we have played three or four rounds of County Championship cricket', those matches at the extreme ends of the season are not adequate build-up to a Test series. The early part of an English summer does not provide a player the opportunity to push his Test credentials.At the moment, we have all this talk of 'The Hundred'. It would be so nice to see English cricket devote that sort of time, effort, manpower and money into making the Championship the best possible breeding ground for Test cricket.Allied to this is the problem that English conditions do not easily allow England teams to prepare for playing away from home. For example, very rarely do you need to play two spinners in England.And so England's dilemma is this: they have to improve results, but at the same time move the team forward and create a depth in the squad that will serve them well in the winter.Ideally, England will win at home, but win the hard way. We want them to make big totals, to bowl teams out in tough conditions, to have to battle into the fifth day. We do not want them conning themselves with wins on a fresh, green pitches against subcontinental teams.  That won't convince anyone that England have turned a corner and are ready for Galle, Colombo, Antigua or Jamaica.That is not a criticism of English conditions. I love to see the ball move around and it is good for visiting teams to come here and be tested.But we don't want to see matches that are deliberately loaded against the away team.
Scrapping toss would make for boring cricketI cannot believe that people are seriously considering supporting the idea of doing away with the toss in Test cricket and giving the choice to the visiting team.That would result in the most bland, benign pitches and therefore the most boring cricket you could imagine, because no home team will want to be caught out batting last on a dry pitch that is starting to turn.I'm staggered that the International Cricket Council is giving it a moment's consideration and I'm really disappointed that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has decided to support it.I feel really strongly about this. I firmly believe that the excuse being made about pitches being to blame for home teams winning so many Test series is a cover for the lack of preparation that visiting teams undertake.If away sides are given proper preparation in the unfamiliar surroundings, they would cope far better than if they squeal that pitches are being rigged.In fact, pitches are not being rigged. I haven't seen a rigged pitch in ages. They weren't when England lost in India and they certainly weren't in Australia. The problem is visiting teams are simply not giving themselves enough time to get used to them.To potentially ruin Test cricket by playing it on pitches like roads is not the answer. It's a smokescreen to cover the real problems.Administrators do not want longer tours because they want to make money from one-day tournaments. That is the reason why touring teams are struggling, not rigged pitches.Even Superman couldn't do Bayliss' jobI've been wondering all winter how Bayliss, or any other person, can do the work that is required in the summer of 2019. How can one man produce a World Cup-winning side and an Ashes-winning team all by himself? That has always seemed like an impossible and unfair workload.Bayliss has to either devote energy to the one-day team for the World Cup or the Test team for the Ashes. I don't see how one man can do both properly. That is something the ECB will have to sort.Yes, it is a big summer for him because England have been a declining force in Test cricket under his stewardship and any decision taken on his future may come down to results produced against Pakistan and India.But even Superman couldn't be expected to do both jobs properly. It is a really difficult situation for the Australian.Big summer for big namesIt is not only Bayliss who is facing an important couple of months. The bigger names in England's team are also at crossroads of varying importance.It is an important time for opener Alastair Cook, who needs runs after a winter that produced only one innings of note.Stuart Broad improved in New Zealand and James Anderson has been excellent for the past year, but they have to show that they have it in them to get through a difficult winter and reach their target of next year's Ashes. They have enough in the tank, but these things can sneak up on you quite quickly.Root will be desperate for an improvement in his team's results. It's fair to say that this England team have not changed much since he took charge a year ago and now, with the Ashes behind him, perhaps he can start to mould it in his image.I don't think people really understood when I said I would have preferred Cook to stay on as captain through the Ashes, then allow Root the chance to bed in over this summer.As it turned out, Root took a battering over the winter and, for all of his confidence, that was not a great experience for a captain in his first year on the job.The selections of Jos Buttler and Dom Bess are exciting, a step in the right direction with an eye on the future. It is a positive sign.'Buttler brings flair to Smith's positive England'
England recall is like another debut - Buttler
Don't underestimate PakistanEngland should beat Pakistan. But they should not be underestimated. In all my talk of poor preparation, they have actually prepared well for this Test, including a win in Ireland.With Pakistan, we know to expect the unexpected. They are talented and frustrating in equal measure. They have not drawn any of their past 20 Tests, so matches they are involved in are unlikely to be dull.In Mohammed Amir, they have a wonderful fast bowler who has put a troubled past behind him and has the ability to cause England serious problems.The first Test of the summer, at Lord's, with the sun set to shine, really is quite an occasion. It should be one to savour.Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.
Nobody expected us to be here - Klopp
BBC coverageHow to follow:Listen on BBC Radio 5 live and BBC Sport website 19:45 BST (build-up from 17:00 BST); live text commentary on the BBC Sport websiteLiverpool approach Saturday's Champions League final against holders Real Madrid in Kiev with a belief they can "go for the big things" embedded in their DNA, says manager Jurgen Klopp.The Reds, who entered in the play-off round, will be crowned champions of Europe for a sixth time if they win.Real are looking to lift the trophy for a third successive season.
"Nobody expected us to be here, but we are because we are Liverpool," said Klopp.A journey that started on 15 August against Hoffenheim will end in glory if the Reds beat the 12-time winners."This club has it in its DNA that it can really go for the big things," said Klopp."I am pretty sure, in the second before the game, Real Madrid will be more confident than we are but the game doesn't end in that second, it only starts."I am really happy to be here with this group of players. They fought unbelievably hard to be here. They deserve it. I'm really proud."How Liverpool's defeat by Real Madrid laid the foundations for Kiev'I'm proud of my boys already.

Zidane has been a fighter his whole life."The Reds were beaten by Sevilla in the 2016 Europa League final.Captain Jordan Henderson says they have moved on from that, but it is important for the team to start winning things."We have learned from that experience and we can use that as motivation," said the England midfielder."We have moved in the right direction since then. It's important we win trophies and hopefully we will win one on Saturday."
Liverpool can hurt Real Madrid - Henderson
Team newsKlopp told a media conference in Kiev he had no fresh injury problems before Liverpool's final training session.There are unlikely to be any surprises in the starting line-up, with James Milner expected to return after a minor muscle issue.Klopp will probably have to chose between Dominic Solanke and Danny Ings for the final place on the substitutes' bench.That is because midfielder Emre Can, who has not featured since mid-March, is expected to be on the bench after recovering from a back injury.
Will Gareth Bale start for Real?The Wales forward was a substitute in both legs of the semi-final against Bayern Munich.Bale is attempting to win his fourth Champions League winners' medal since moving to Spain five years ago.Zidane also has to decide whether to play France forward Karim Benzema alongside Cristiano Ronaldo, who has 15 Champions League goals this season - five more than Mohamed Salah.
Gareth Bale (right) has been hampered with injuries but has still scored 19 goals for Real this seasonThird time lucky for Klopp?Klopp will be hoping it is a case of third time lucky for Liverpool, with the Reds having reached two finals under him.They lost in the 2016 League Cup showpiece to Manchester City on penalties, before going down to Sevilla three months later.Klopp is hoping to become the fourth manager to lead Liverpool to a European Cup/Champions League triumph after Bob Paisley (1977, 1978 and 1981), Joe Fagan (1984) and Rafael Benitez (2005).But he has been beaten in his past five finals, including an all-German 2013 Champions League decider between Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich."The Champions League final is really big," he said."Going to the Champions League final is difficult to do, maybe a once-in-a-lifetime chance, and I know that is how I felt at the time."We played an unbelievable game against a strong side and after the game I knew I wanted to have that chance again."How will Real deal with Liverpool 'Red Arrows'?'This is history' - Gareth BaleWe're not favourites - ZidaneReal are attempting to become the first team since Bayern Munich (1974-1976) to win the competition three years in a row.However, Zidane denied his side were favourites against Liverpool."We will not live this moment again. We have to make the most of it," he said."We have the same chance as Liverpool. Favourites? In the dressing room that is not what we believe."Real have multiple European Cup winners in their side, with Ronaldo seeking to become the first player to win the competition five times in the Champions League era."He lives for these matches, to play in these matches," added Zidane. "That's what his life is all about. That's what makes him tick."'Confident, calm and jovial Klopp'BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty in KievJurgen Klopp was exactly as Liverpool and their fans have come to expect as he addressed the media on the eve of the Champions League final in Kiev.Klopp, along with captain Jordan Henderson and defender Virgil van Dijk, was in calm and confident mood before facing Real Madrid - with the manager also drawing some laughs along the way.He accepted Real's vast experience will be an advantage before the game but there is no mistaking Klopp believes Liverpool have earned themselves a huge opportunity for sixth crown here in steamy Kiev.The obvious faith Klopp has in his players, and vice-versa, was striking in their media briefing and is clearly a key component in the way they have grown into the Champions League this season.Real have the experience but....Spanish football journalist Guillem Balague in KievSeventeen Real Madrid players have played in the Champions League final. Liverpool have one who was on the bench and didn't even play a minute.Real have got the better side, the better players, the better experience.But Liverpool can win. The first minutes will be crucial.
This is a repeat of the 1981 European Cup final, which Liverpool won 1-0 thanks to an Alan Kennedy goalAnother Liverpool clean sheet?Liverpool have kept six clean sheets in the competition this season - no side has kept more.Spanish sides have won their past six major European finals against English sides (excluding Super Cups).Ronaldo has scored more Champions League final goals than any other player (four).No player to have played for Liverpool this season has previously appeared in a Champions League final.Milner has provided a competition-high eight assists in the Champions League this season.

"It's not about ugly versus beautiful, it's saying the sexual objectification of women in sport is not OK."Formula 1's owner Liberty Media stopped the use of 'grid girls' in January, saying their use was "at odds with modern day societal norms".Traditionally, grid girls would hold driver placards on the grid but the Monaco models - who will include men - will only be there as representatives of Tag Heuer, taking pictures of the drivers to be posted on social media.Both world champion Hamilton and Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel supported the decision to have female models on the grid."Women are the most beautiful thing in the world," said 33-year-old Mercedes driver Hamilton."Monaco is a very elegant grand prix and when we pull up to the grid and there's beautiful women on the grid, that's the Monaco Grand Prix and that's a lovely thing."Former world champion Vettel added: "I like women. I think they look beautiful. The bottom line is that there is too much of a fuss nowadays."Copeland, 36, who has campaigned for the end of ring girls in boxing, said it was imperative to end these traditions in sport."Change is always really tough and will have its ups and downs, but just because we've always done something does not mean it should carry on."Grid girls in F1 and ring girls in boxing are unnecessary and unequal so we have to over-correct."Why are they used at the Giro?
German rider Maximilian Schachmann (centre) is congratulated after winning the 18th stage at this year Giro d'ItaliaThe Giro d'Italia remains the only one of the major cycling tours which features female models kissing the respective leading riders after the end of each stage.The Tour de France no longer uses podium girls, and the Vuelta a Espana used smartly-dressed men and women in 2017.Giro race director Mauro Vegni said earlier this year that the halt in using the models in other races is just a fad."RCS Sport [race organisers] believe that in this specific moment it is more of a temporary trend to remove them from sport events," he said."As long as those girls are treated with respect and carry on their job in a professional manner, there is no reason for changing the hospitality process."

Highlights: Pakistan take control of first Test
First Test, Lord's (day two)England 184: Cook 70, Abbas 4-23, Hasan 4-51Pakistan 350-8: Babar 68 retired hurt, Shafiq 59, Shadab 52, Azhar 50Pakistan lead by 166 runsScorecardPakistan patiently took a firm grip on the first Test against England on the second day at Lord's.Babar Azam, Azhar Ali, Asad Shafiq and Shadab Khan made half-centuries to help the tourists to 350-8, a lead of 166.They gave England, who were bowled out for 184 on day one, a lesson in the discipline, diligence and control required to make runs in Test cricket.
In improved batting conditions, England's bowling was adequate but lacking the penetration demonstrated by Pakistan on Thursday, perhaps leaving captain Joe Root rueing his decision to bat first.The home side also did not help themselves by dropping three catches and missing another, to go with a Ben Stokes drop from the first evening.Stokes at least brought much-needed venom to the home attack, taking three wickets and forcing Babar to retire hurt on 68 with what proved to be a broken wrist.It may be that Pakistan already have a match-winning lead, while England's hopes rest on a rapid conclusion of the innings followed by a vastly improved display with the bat.In truth, though, they need to pull off a remarkable fightback to avoid an eighth consecutive Test without a win.'England need oiling' - Test Match Special podcast
'He couldn't deal with it' - Stokes dismisses Shafiq
Pakistan teach England a lessonIf England's 13-match winless streak away from home can partly be put down to not having the tools for unfamiliar conditions, being so outplayed for two days at Lord's by Pakistan is a huge concern.Collectively, Pakistan have had greater preparation for this match and it has shone through with bat, ball and in the field. England may point to Pakistan having more favourable conditions in which to bowl - that was England's choice, though - but the home side have no excuse for the way they have been outfought with the bat.Bar visiting captain Sarfraz Ahmed, who threw his wicket away with a hook at Stokes, Pakistan have shown the concentration and control that was beyond England, leaving with good judgement, defending solidly and scoring when given the opportunity.Whereas Pakistan held all chances presented to them on day one, England's catching was woeful.
Jos Buttler put down Asad Shafiq the ball before he edged Stokes to Dawid MalanJos Buttler's acrobatic dive to try to grab Shafiq off Stokes can be excused - Shafiq was dismissed next ball - but Alastair Cook had an awful day at first slip. He missed Babar, on only 10, low to his right, watched an edge off Faheem Ashraf fly between himself and wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow and, in the next over, missed a straightforward chance from Shadab off James Anderson.Disciplined Pakistan slowly seize controlWith Pakistan resuming on 50-1, 134 behind on a grey morning, England will have had hope of taking the early wickets that would have dragged them back into the contest. However, they were blunted by a touring batting line-up that practised the virtues of orthodox Test batting.
Wood removes Sohail as England toil
Azhar played handsomely through the off side for his 50, sharing 75 for the second wicket with the watchful Haris Sohail.Shafiq, who made 59, was compact bar some fortune off the edge and the occasional swipe at debutant off-spinner Dom Bess, who was slogged over cow corner for six.Babar has excelled in limited-overs cricket and grew from a nervous beginning into playing attractive drives. It was a surprise when he ducked into a Stokes bouncer and had to leave the field.Still the resistance came. Shadab was another who favoured the off side, reaching 52 before becoming one more victim to the Stokes short ball.England probe without patience If England's batsmen suffered from a lack of patience on day one, perhaps the same can be said for the bowlers on Friday.Although it is legitimate for an attack and the captain to explore all options, rarely was a plan given time to breathe.Mark Wood was asked to send down a barrage of bouncers inside the first 50 minutes of the day, accompanied by the unusual sight of Root fielding at short leg.England did not bowl badly in conditions less helpful than the first day; the bat was beaten with regularity.However, it was left to Stokes to provide the majority of the potency, the all-rounder accounting for Shafiq, Sarfraz and Shadab with short balls as well as striking an incapacitating blow to Babar's left wrist.Like England's catching, Anderson improved late in the day to bowl Faheem and have Hasan Ali held at gully.It may, though, have already been too late.'England well and truly outplayed' - what they saidFormer England spinner Phil Tufnell on BBC Test Match Special: "England have been well and truly outplayed again."It shows through the fielding. Pakistan clung on to everything and it makes you seem together as a side. They have done the basics better than England."A lead of 166 on a pitch that is only going to get worse... England have got to somehow go out and get 400. There might be a chat or two behind a closed door in the dressing room this evening."Former England captain Michael Vaughan: "I don't think England can save this - unless there's rain. The maturity and discipline this inexperienced Pakistan side have shown has been tremendous."BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew: "England are going to have to play so much better than they have batted in a long time if they are to save this game."England bowler Mark Wood: "On the last day, if the pitch is dry, hopefully reverse and spin comes into it and if we can get a bit of a lead, we can put pressure on."We've got plenty of fight in the dressing room and plenty of experience - it's going to be a big effort, though.Pakistan batsman Azhar Ali: "The conditions weren't that easy for batting but the way the batsmen fought in the middle against a good English bowling attack was very exceptional we are all very happy with the position, but we have to keep playing good cricket. "Test cricket is always very tough and there is still a long way to go."
Henry Trinder has played 101 times for Gloucester but has never won an England capHenry Trinder says chronic injury problems left him contemplating retirement, but he is determined to "enjoy and embrace" his England recall.The Gloucester back, 29, will start at outside centre against the Barbarians on Sunday.He played in the same fixture seven years ago, but then suffered a series of injuries.
"I got closer than I would have liked [to retirement]," he told BBC Radio 5 live."You do think about it, and you have nights when you lie awake and mope around the house. But it was a good decision that I didn't. "The reason I was thinking about retirement was the mental disappointment of going through it all again. I blew out my knee in 2015, had nine months to get back from that, came back and did it again. "I had about four or five injuries before that one and I did just think it was my body saying 'this is not for you'."Elliot Daly at full-back against Barbarians at TwickenhamTrinder says the support of his family helped him through the difficult times, and after an outstanding season for Gloucester he is now firmly in England head coach Eddie Jones' plans."You have those time in sport when you do get down, and you have to almost ride that rollercoaster," he added."With the help of your family, your wife, and your friends around you, you get back on the horse and go again. "Those lows are what make these highs even better. To represent your country is a true honour and something I am really looking forward to."I am here to prove a point, and enjoy and embrace everything."Trinder was drafted into camp by Jones as injury cover for Sale's Cameron Redpath, who had knee surgery on Thursday. "We've been really impressed with Henry Trinder," Jones told BBC Radio 5 live. "I know he was a very good young player who had a tough time with injury."He has come into camp full of enthusiasm, a sense of maturity, and he has really impressed us."
Junior Vaivai scored two tries after shrugging off an injury at Magic Weekend just five days earlierBetfred Super LeagueHull KR (10) 24Tries: Vaivai 2, Quinlan, Atkin Goals: Tickle 4Wigan (8) 8Tries: J Tomkins Goals: S Tomkins 2Wigan Warriors suffered a first defeat in nine games as they were shocked by Super League bottom club Hull KR,Wigan led 8-0 when Joel Tomkins latched onto George Williams' kick through to score, followed by brother Sam Tomkins' conversion and a penalty. But Rovers responded with 24 unanswered points with fit-again Junior Vaivai scoring two of their four tries.
Adam Quinlan crossed before the break, while Chris Atkin scored a second-half try and Danny Tickle landed four goals.This was the two sides' third meeting inside two months and Wigan had won the first two - 44-6 in Super League, then 28-10 in the Challenge Cup just a fortnight ago. But, in their first game since head coach Shaun Wane announced he will leave at the end of the season, the Warriors were outplayed.Rovers' win, only their fourth in 15 league games this season, came at a cost as winger Justin Carney, on his return from a shoulder injury a month ahead of schedule, played the whole of the second half with a broken hand.But the victory lifts them two places off the foot of the table, while Wigan's four-point gap on third-placed Warrington was cut to just two points by Wire's 30-12 win at home to Hull.After being forced to dig deep on their own line in the face of Wigan's early pressure, which had seen Joel Tomkins go over, the hosts got back in the game against the run of play when hooker Tommy Lee exploited space with a kick for Vaivai to race onto.Danny Tickle - sent off in the Cup clash - added the extras from out wide. And, after turning down an easy two points from a penalty, the home side's gamble paid off when Quinlan went in for a second try in five minutes from Will Dagger's offload.After Atkin came off the bench to dummy his way over close to the posts on 52 minutes, Tickle added the extras to make it 16-8, then added a penalty in the same incident that had Joel Tomkins sin-binned for dissent with 11 minutes to go. And the man advantage proved crucial when Vaivai sprinted 40 metres from James Greenwood's offload to score the final try following a Wigan error.Hull KR head coach Tim Sheens: "That's probably our best performance of the season. We defended well, our completion rate was good and so were our energy levels."Wigan have turned up thinking that two weeks ago they got us and that they'd get us again, especially when they scored so early."But two weeks ago we felt we could have won that game, so the belief in ourselves was there." Wigan head coach Shaun Wane told BBC Radio Manchester:"We were poor. We made too many errors and had too many pressure releases. We need to be a bit smarter."To say I'm frustrated is putting it lightly. I'm really disappointed but it's our first bad one this year."When we came back from Australia it was different. This one is tough to deal with. We were under the pump all night and we didn't help ourselves."Hull KR: Quinlan; Wallis, Salter, Vaivai, Carney; Dagger, Blair; Johnson, Lee, Greenwood, Clarkson, Tickle, Donaldson.Interchange: Masoe, Scruton, Atkin, Kavanagh.Sin-bin: Johnson (88) Wigan: S Tomkins; Davies, Bateman, Forsyth, L Marshall; Williams, Escare; Navarrete, Powell, Flower, Isa, Farrell, J Tomkins.interchange: Clubb, Sutton, Tautai, Ganson.Sin-bin: J Tomkins (69) Referee: Ben Thaler (RFL).
Spain's Rafael Nadal won his 10th Roland Garros title in Paris last year2018 French OpenVenue: Roland Garros, Paris Dates: 27 May-10 JuneCoverage: Daily live radio and text commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live and the BBC Sport websiteSharp terracotta clay courts, luscious backdrops with the Eiffel Tower looming in the distance, rows of pristine Parisians wearing Panama hats... unmistakeably the French Open at Roland Garros.The second Grand Slam of the tennis calendar - and the only major on clay - begins on Sunday.Spain's 16-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal is still the man to beat in Paris, while 23-time major winner Serena Williams is the star attraction in the women's draw.
However, two of the biggest names will not be playing in the French capital - 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer and Britain's former world number one Andy Murray.In Murray's absence, the British charge will be led by Kyle Edmund in the men's draw and Johanna Konta in the women's.Here's everything you need to know...Is Zverev a Grand Slam champion in the making?Live scores, schedule and resultsAlerts: Get tennis news sent to your phoneWho can stop the King of Clay?Beating Nadal on a clay court is the ultimate challenge in tennis  - a notion both 12-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and three-time Grand Slam champion Murray agree on. And, once again, the 31-year-old Spaniard is the favourite to win at Roland Garros.Nadal triumphed in Paris last year, becoming the first player - male or female - to win the same Grand Slam tournament 10 times in the Open era.Worryingly for his rivals, he has picked up where he left off last year on the clay, lifting his 11th titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona on his way to a record 50-set winning streak on a single surface.Eventually that run came to an end in a defeat by Dominic Thiem in Madrid - Nadal's first loss on clay since the Austrian world number eight beat him in Rome 12 months previously. Normal service resumed for the Spaniard at the Italian Open, a gutsy three-set victory over Germany's in-form Alexander Zverev giving him an eighth title in Rome, and helping him regain the world number one ranking from long-time rival Roger Federer.Nevertheless Nadal - who begins his defence against Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov - deflected talk of lifting the Coupe des Mousquetaires for an 11th time following his win in Rome."Conditions in Paris are completely different," he said. "I don't believe that what happened, even if I lost - even with the victory - creates a big impact about what can happen in Paris."
Where's Federer?
Federer waved 'au revoir' until the summer following his Miami Open defeat in MarchFor the second year running, Federer - who turns 37 in August - has decided to skip the entire clay-court season.When announcing his decision last year, he spoke about the need to be smart with his scheduling to prolong his career, and the French Open - on his least favourite surface and a tournament which he has won only once in 2009 - has been sacrificial.The decision proved to be a sensible one last year as a refreshed Federer returned to the court for the grass season, going on to lift a record eighth Wimbledon title.The Swiss maestro regained the world number one ranking in February after a blistering start to the year in which he claimed the Australian Open during a 17-match winning run.But successive defeats - by Juan Martin del Potro in the Indian Wells final, followed by a shock loss against injury-hit Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis - preceded the announcement Federer would again skip Roland Garros.Federer has not played in Paris since 2015, leading to some suggestions - including from his old rival - that he does not fancy meeting Nadal on clay.

Edmund ready for first Slam as Britain's top man
Edmund, ranked 17th, has broken into the world's top 20 for the first timeWith Murray still not fully recovered from hip surgery, Edmund goes into his first Grand Slam as the British number one.It is the first Slam since the 2006 US Open where three-time major champion Murray has not been ranked as the country's leading player.Of course, Edmund has played on the biggest stage without Murray's shadow looming - most notably at the Australian Open in January.The 22-year-old became only the sixth British man in the Open era to reach a Grand Slam semi-final, seeing his remarkable run ended in the last four by Croatia's 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic. Since then the Yorkshireman has also beaten 2016 French Open champion Djokovic in Madrid, helping him climb into the world's top 20 for the first time.He will begin his campaign against young Australian Alex de Minaur.Cameron Norrie is the only other Briton in the men's singles draw. The world number 102, who shot to prominence in the Davis Cup defeat by Spain in March, has gained direct entry to a Grand Slam for the first time and will face Germany's Peter Gojowczyk in the first round.Who can stop Nadal?Alexander Zverev: The man identified by many as Nadal's biggest threat. The 21-year-old German is the leading player on the ATP Tour this year, having won 30 matches and claimed clay-court titles in Munich and Madrid. However, he has never gone past the last 16 of a Grand Slam.Marin Cilic: The powerful Croat reached a career-high third in the world following his run to the Australian Open final, but has never gone beyond the last eight at Roland Garros. Runs to the Monte Carlo quarter-finals and Rome semi-finals, however, have left the 29-year-old hoping he can go deep in the draw in Paris.Novak Djokovic: The once-dominant Serb has dropped down the rankings after an elbow injury which has disrupted his career since Wimbledon. He is now ranked 22nd in the world, but showed glimpses of returning to his best form with a run to the Italian Open semi-finals this month.Dominic Thiem: The one man to have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in the past two years. And it is a feat the 24-year-old Austrian has achieved twice - in Rome last year and in Madrid earlier this month. He is yet to transfer his talent into major prizes, having still not managed to land a Masters title, although he has reached the Roland Garros semi-finals for two years running.Stan Wawrinka: A frustrating year for the 2015 champion, who has been sidelined by a knee injury for much of the past year. The 33-year-old Swiss has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the past three years, but a lack of time on court means a similar feat this year might be beyond him.
Serena out of match practice - but 'can still win'
Serena Williams is aiming for a first Grand Slam title since having a babySerena Williams has only played four Tour matches since returning to the court after giving birth to daughter Alexis in September - but that has not stopped coach Patrick Mouratoglou saying the 23-time Grand Slam champion can still win in Paris.Williams, 36, lost to older sister Venus in the last 32 in Indian Wells on her WTA return in March, then went out to Japan's rising star Naomi Osaka in round one at Miami a fortnight later.The former world number one has plummeted to 453rd in the world rankings, but is able to use her protected ranking to play at Roland Garros. The unseeded American starts against Czech Kristyna Pliskova.If she does win a fourth French Open singles crown, although there are still question marks about her fitness and sharpness, it will take her level with Margaret Court's all-time Grand Slam record of 24 majors.Inspired to play tennis?

However, she has won only one of her past eight finals - including defeat by Jelena Ostapenko in last year's Roland Garros showpiece.Caroline Wozniacki: The Dane landed her first Grand Slam title with victory over Halep at the Australian Open in January and is second in the year's Race to Singapore standings. Clay, however, is not her favourite surface, having never won a title on the red dirt.Elina Svitolina:  For the second year running, the Ukrainian world number four goes into Roland Garros as the Italian Open champion. In contrast to Halep, whom she beat in Rome, Svitolina has won her past eight finals - although has never reached a Grand Slam semi-final.Jelena Ostapenko: The unseeded Latvian shocked the world 12 months ago when her all-out attacking game led to her an unlikely Roland Garros victory - just two days after her 20th birthday. She has maintained her place in the world's top 10 since, despite a patchy 2018 which has brought only one final. But she cannot be counted out - especially with the experience of savouring victory - to succeed again on her favoured surface.Maria Sharapova: A two-time champion at Roland Garros, the Russian will be among the seeds for the first time at a Grand Slam since returning from a 15-month doping ban last year.
Konta aiming to prove she can compete on clayBritish number one Johanna Konta showed she was among the best on grass during her memorable run to the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, but it has been a different story on clay. The 27-year-old only managed to win two matches on the surface last year, and has never progressed past the first round at Roland Garros.But she showed encouraging signs by reaching the last 16 in Rome before losing to Ostapenko.'I've never believed that I'm not good on this surface," said Konta, who plays Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva in the opening round.Konta has slipped to 22nd in the world rankings since her Wimbledon heroics propelled her to a career-high fourth, reaching just one quarter-final this year.She is joined in the main draw by Heather Watson, who has also struggling for form but ended a four-month losing streak this week with a victory in Nuremberg. The 26-year-old has dropped to 87th in the rankings and starts against home hopeful Oceane Dodin.Also in the main draw - representing Australia - is Inverness-raised Isabelle Wallace. The 21-year-old left the Highlands at the age of 10 due to a lack of funding and tennis resources and now lives in Spain. However, she told BBC Sport that she will be representing Scotland when she opens against Alison van Uytvanck of Belgium."Even though I'm Australian, everyone back home is full of support. I still think of myself as Scottish," she said. "I think a lot of people would understand in my situation and it's the right thing to."

England's Tommy Fleetwood, the Race To Dubai champion, stayed in touch on eight under after a round of 66.Live second round leaderboard Fleetwood's compatriot Robert Rock shot a 68 to move to seven under alongside Sweden's defending champion Alex Noren (68), Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat (69) and Italy's Francesco Molinari (67).Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell is a shot back from that trio, after his 67 took him to six under alongside nine others, including overnight leader Lucas Bjerregaard of Denmark (73) and England's Matthew Fitzpatrick (71).Former world number one Lee Westwood's round of 69 took him to five under, level with fellow Englishmen Andy Sullivan (68), Ross Fisher (68) and James Heath (67).
McDowell hopes to change 'disappointing' Wentworth form
England's Paul Waring had the week's first hole-in-one - at the par-three fifth - en route to a 68 to sit three under overall.The cut at the European Tour's flagship event came at one under.Those missing the weekend include two-time major winner Martin Kaymer, former Masters champion Danny Willett, Tyrrell Hatton, Jamie Donaldson, Padraig Harrington and Andrew Johnston. Another to miss out is Belgium's Thomas Pieters, who snapped an iron around his neck after a poor shot on the par-five fourth.Horsfield and Fleetwood lead England's challengeHorsfield, the world 285, only turned professional last year and is playing in his debut season on the European Tour.The Orlando-based golfer, who was born in Manchester, bogeyed the 17th and holed a par on the 18th to card a 68 to add to Thursday's 67."I think any time you're playing on the weekend and you're up there near Rory, I think you're going to be doing pretty well," said Horsfield.World number 12 Fleetwood chipped in for birdies on the 13th and 16th and finished strongly with three birdies."It is nice to have made some ground on him, but giving Rory headway is never a good way to success, but you never know," said the Southport golfer."I am in a very good spot for the weekend."McIlroy's 'best' round of 2018Four-time major champion McIlroy had trailed by two shots overnight, and missed short putts on the first three holes.But he led by the turn after three birdies and extended his advantage by gaining shots on the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th.He was unable to birdie the 16th or 17th and had to settle for another par on the 18th after his approach to the par-five green plugged in a bunker."On the first three holes I hit it to six to eight feet and none of them went in and I thought 'Here we go'," said McIlroy, who has the second lowest 36-hole total in the tournament's history. "But I played great after that. It was one of the best rounds of golf I've played this year, ball-striking-wise."I had everything sort of firing today and it was nice to take advantage of the opportunities I gave myself."There's a lot of guys still to go out but hopefully I keep the lead and will be in the final group tomorrow. It will be nice to go out and feel that."He added: "It's nice to live up to the billing [as pre-tournament favourite]."Playing partner Noren said: "That's the best round I've ever seen."

Muir breaks Holmes' 1500m British record
London Anniversary Games, London StadiumDate: Saturday, 21 July - Sunday, 22 July Time: 13:15-17:15 BST Saturday, 13:00-17:00 SundayCoverage: Saturday live on BBC1, Sunday live on BBC2Laura Muir will attempt to set a new British mile record at the London Anniversary Games on Sunday, 22 July.The double world indoor medallist broke Kelly Holmes' 1500m British record at the same event in 2016.Now the 25-year-old Scot hopes to beat Zola Budd's 33-year-old record of four minutes 17.57 seconds over a mile.
"The mile has a special place in British distance running history so it's super we are getting a chance to race the mile," Muir said.
Muir second in mile with personal best
Muir just missed out on bettering Budd's mark at last year's London Anniversary Games, when she finished second in a time of 4:18.03 at London Stadium.She added: "First and foremost, I am looking to win the race, but in doing so if I can break the British record that would be fantastic. It'd be somewhat fitting in a year in which we lost the legendary Sir Roger Bannister."Cherry Alexander, major events director at UK Athletics, added: "We all remember that stunning night at the event two years ago when she lowered the 1500m record and claimed a remarkable victory."The noise of the British crowd really did make a difference on that night, which does show there is nothing quite like home support."
F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault at the end of 2017, joins the BBC team this season to offer insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.Romain Grosjean is going through tough times in Formula 1 and he hit a real low point with his crash on the first lap at the Spanish Grand Prix.The Haas driver lost his car mid-pack at Turn Three, span back across the track in a cloud of tyre smoke and collected the cars of Nico Hulkenberg and Pierre Gasly.
I don't remember an incident like it and I don't think the stewards did either - which is why they have given him a three-place penalty at the Monaco Grand Prix.It is the latest - and worst - in a series of difficult moments for Grosjean this year.Hamilton dominates in Spain after Grosjean crashListen: Spanish Grand Prix review Magnussen showing Grosjean up The Frenchman has no points after five races and that is made worse by the fact Haas have been very competitive, and team-mate Kevin Magnussen has been getting the most out of the car more often than not.The Dane's sixth place in Barcelona puts him on 19 points for the year.It hasn't been a lack of pace that's hurt Grosjean - Barcelona was the third time in five races that he's qualified in the top 10.The Haas car has often been best of the rest behind the big three this year, and races without incident surely would have seen Grosjean bag some good points by now.The problems have not all been of his own doing, either.In Melbourne in the first race of the season, he was running in a fantastic fifth place when his wheel didn't go on at his pit stop, a problem that ended the race of both Haas cars.
During the opener in Australia, Haas were running well in fourth and fifth before the cars failed to have their front left (Magnussen) and rear left (Grosjean) wheels secured properly during the pit stopsBut where Magnussen has been able to get his head down and recover from that disappointment, scoring in every other race apart from the chaotic event in Azerbaijan, Grosjean has been on an unfortunate run of incidents which have put him heavily on the back foot.Bahrain and China were quietly disappointing for Grosjean, but in Baku he had a real chance to step up and score some points.He was forced to start at the back of the grid after an issue in qualifying, but a brilliant race saw him running up in sixth as a late safety car was called. He then lost control of his car, trying to keep temperature in his tyres under the safety car and hit the wall, ending his race.Listen: Grosjean, Hulkenberg & Gasly 'wiped out' on opening lapListen: Azerbaijan GP - 'Grosjean's binned it behind the safety car' When tyre temperatures are low, silly mistakes are much easier than they look in F1, and Grosjean isn't the first driver in recent times to lose it under the safety car. Indeed, Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo, winner last month in China, had a spin under the virtual safety car in Barcelona. But it will have been slightly humiliating for Grosjean nevertheless, especially because he was in such a great position beforehand and it ended his race with a big accident.That was two weeks ago. In Barcelona, he had another chance to set the record straight after qualifying in the top 10 again.'Dangerous and foolhardy'
Grosjean kept his foot buried on the throttle after he lost control of his car behind team-mate MagnussenGrosjean's lap-one incident really surprised me. Not so much the incident itself - everybody was struggling for grip. Even the frontrunners with clearer air ahead and more downforce were struggling to get the power down out of Turn Two. The spin Grosjean had was one thing. He was caught out by Magnussen's slide ahead, spun in sympathy as a result of cold tyres and plenty of dirty air. Not great, but that sort of thing happens from time to time.What I couldn't understand was why he kept his foot planted on the throttle for so long afterwards. The result was the car drifting right back into the middle of a field of oncoming cars, creating a huge smokescreen for them at the same time, and on one of the fastest, most difficult sections of track. It was inevitable he would be collected by someone. I can only imagine his actions came out of frustration at spinning away a good starting position. But it was pretty dangerous and very foolhardy, as proved by the fact Gasly and Hulkenberg drove into him, unsighted by tyre smoke and with nowhere else to go.If Grosjean had applied the brakes as he spun on the outside, as is usually the case and the natural instinct when a driver loses control, I'm sure he would have come to a stop harmlessly on the run-off and got going again afterwards. A personal experience with Grosjean 
Game over: Palmer and Grosjean were sent spinning at the first corner in Sochi last yearI had an incident with Grosjean in Sochi last year. He tipped me into a spin and then drove into the front of my spinning car. We ended up in the wall, putting us both out at the start of the race.The stewards deemed it a racing incident, which seemed fair enough, even though we both disagreed, as is natural for drivers to do.At the time Romain's biggest complaint was that I kept the throttle on as I was spinning and didn't just hit the brakes, which he saw as the reason he was collected and pitched into the wall. I distinctly remember him saying what I did that day was "dangerous".In fact, I didn't keep my foot down. But as he hit me while I was accelerating, I naturally had some throttle still on. As soon as I was spinning I liftedBut that's irrelevant now. What it shows is his mindset, and how in the crunch moment he wasn't able to think the same way he had managed in the stewards' room before.Talent behind the errors 
Grosjean celebrated a hard-fought podium finish for Lotus at the 2015 Belgium Grand Prix from ninth place on the gridI know it's easy for me to say this from the outside now. In the midst of any race incident things happen very quickly and a driver reacts in a split second to try to best deal with it.But I've seen first hand how good Grosjean can be. In his Lotus days alongside Kimi Raikkonen, he scored numerous podiums, nearly won at Suzuka in Japan and was often the closest man to challenge a dominant Sebastian Vettel in the Red Bull in that era.I joined Grosjean at Lotus as third driver in 2015 and could witness his speed myself. He scored an incredible podium that year at the Belgian Grand Prix for a team so cash-strapped it had the bailiffs coming round immediately after the race. When he switched to Haas at the end of that year with the hope of a future move to Ferrari, it seemed ambitious but not unrealistic. Now it seems impossible.
Publicly, the relationship between the two appears to be fine - but can it last? BBC Sport takes a look at some other notable team-mate tangles and what happened next.Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber, Turkey 2010
The perfectly straight line at the Istanbul Park in Turkey..."We've got to sit down with both drivers and make sure that this never happens again."It must feel like deja vu for Red Bull team principal Christian Horner, who said the above when two of his previous drivers collided during a race eight years ago.Back in 2010, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber were Red Bull team-mates but their relationship took a turn for the worse when they collided at the Turkish Grand Prix - driving in a straight line, as Verstappen and Ricciardo were - as a one-two finish was firmly on the cards.What happened next?Horner invited the two drivers over to his house for a night of karaoke and guitar playing in the hope it would bring harmony to the feuding team-mates. However, while an uneasy truce did develop, things would never be the same again.At the time, neither had won a world title, but as 2010 signalled an era when Red Bull would dominate the sport things were never going to go smoothly.Fast forward to 2013 and Vettel - now with three world championship titles under his belt - famously ignored the "multi 21" instruction to not pass Webber at the Malaysian Grand Prix and let the Australian win in a bid for his own crown.Instead, the German instead said over team radio: "Mark is too slow, please move him out of the way." He then took things into his own hands and barged his way past Webber to claim victory.Their time as team-mates ended that year when Webber - empty handed and disillusioned - retired from Formula 1.
...but it somehow ended with Webber walking one way and Vettel pointing towards his head indicating someone had a screw looseAlain Prost and Ayrton Senna, Japan 1989
This is comfortably one of the most well-known on-track clashes involving team-mates in Formula 1. Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna were McLaren's drivers and both going for the 1989 title when they started the Japanese Grand Prix, the penultimate race of the season.Prost was leading the championship, with Senna fighting to take the battle into the final race, and with seven laps to go the Brazilian attempted an ambitious dive up the inside of his team-mate at the final chicane. Prost shut the door and the two collided.If both retired, Prost would be champion but Senna got his car going again and recovered to win the race. He was, however, disqualified for cutting a chicane on his way to victory, handing the Frenchman the title.
"Where are you going?" Senna finished the race but was disqualifiedWhat happened next?Their time as team-mates came to an end as Prost left McLaren to join Ferrari in 1990 - but their rivalry continued and once again the Japanese Grand Prix that year saw a coming together between the two on the circuit. This time, Senna turned into Prost soon after the race start, sending both cars hurtling into the gravel trap and out of the contest. As a consequence, Senna became world champion. 1-1.Perhaps it was best they never came as close to challenging each other again. Both would claim one more title during their careers, but they will forever be remembered for the period at the end of the 1980s when they were virtually stuck to one another.Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton, Belgium 2014
Belgium 2014 was more of a scrape...They were karting buddies and even raced each other when they were eating pizza, so it seemed that when childhood friends Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg became Mercedes team-mates, they would only want the best for each other, right?It started off well enough in 2013, but once things began to get heated on the track after they were given a title-winning car, their relationship deteriorated, with one of the first big flash points happening at the 2014 Belgian Grand Prix.The two touched on lap two of the race when Rosberg attempted a move on Hamilton, with the disbelieving Briton saying: "Nico's hit me..."Rosberg lost part of his front wing but managed to plough on and finish second, but Hamilton suffered a puncture in the incident and eventually retired on lap 39.What happened next?A very strong discussion in the motorhome after the race, followed by Hamilton claiming the title that year.Many more heated moments would follow. There was the infamous 'cap gate', when Hamilton threw a second place cap at Rosberg after victory for the Briton at the 2015 United States Grand Prix sealed another world title.Then there was the coming together at the Spanish Grand Prix a year later when Rosberg closed the door as Hamilton approached with too much speed attempting to take the lead, ending both of their races.By the time they collided at the 2016 Austrian Grand Prix, they were sworn enemies, but Rosberg's world title that year was enough for him and he retired.Esteban Ocon and Sergio Perez, Belgium 2017
"He tried to kill me."That was Esteban Ocon's blunt view after he and Force India team-mate Sergio Perez made contact during last year's Belgian Grand Prix.The simmering rivalry between the two had already dashed their chances of a podium at the Canadian Grand Prix and hopes of a top-three finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix were also ended when the two collided.But lessons were not learned as neither gave each other space on the run down the hill from La Source to Eau Rouge and the inevitable crash happened.What happened next?Force India were furious and, after initially letting their drivers race, they said team orders would be imposed after Belgium.The two drivers, meanwhile, accepted the need to talk it out. "I believe a new relationship can start from now and we can work as a team and put the interests of the team first," said Perez in August last year.Since then, so far so good. The pair were retained as team-mates for this season and last weekend Perez secured a top-three finish for the team with a superb third in Azerbaijan.But will it last?

Alonso's front right tyre can be seen starting to collapse after a collision at the Azerbaijan Grand PrixFernando Alonso described his drive in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, in which he took a badly damaged McLaren to a seventh-place finish, as "one of the best races of my life". Only now, though, can it be revealed exactly how good a performance it was.The Spaniard slipped under the radar in the immediate aftermath of the race in Baku, probably because events at the front were so dramatic. 
But Alonso's afternoon also deserves exploring. BBC Sport was given exclusive access to the two-time champion's car at the McLaren factory as it arrived back from Baku and can reveal the extent of the damage and the effect on its performance.Alonso himself was shown photographs of the damage to his car on Monday, and said on Twitter: "Now I have no doubt. It was an unrepeatable race."It's not the first time the two-time world champion has talked up his own performances since joining McLaren and being saddled with an uncompetitive car. Without judging the other occasions, though, this time it was undoubtedly justified.Racing director Eric Boullier, who showed me around the car, said the Spaniard's performance was "a mega race. What he did is unbelievable."
Alonso tweeted this photo of his car after the race, saying he was "proud" of his driveHow bad was the damage?Alonso was caught in a collision with two other cars between turns two and three on the first lap and suffered punctures in both his right-hand tyres. By the time he reached turn 15, two corners before the long pit straight, it was down to its wheel rims. The 36-year-old somehow dragged the car back to the pits, but in the process it suffered extensive damage.The aerodynamics of Formula 1 cars are extremely sensitive, and each flick and curve on the extensively sculpted bodywork is there for a reason - to enhance performance.I was not allowed to take photographs, for confidentiality reasons. But the most dramatic damage to Alonso's car was to what is called the 'tea-tray' - the part of the floor that sticks out under the drivers legs, and which helps define the airflow under and around the sides of the car. In the front of this there was a triangular hole, about 30cm by 20cm, as well as significant damage to the leading edge, as if someone had set about it with a powerful hammer. Some of the heavy tungsten ballast that is stored in the floor was missing.At the back of the car, there was damage along the right-hand side of the floor all the way from the very back of the diffuser - the upward slope at the rear - to forward of the rear wheel.Two sculpted curves on the right-hand side of the rear diffuser were gone. In front of the rear tyre, two key aerodynamic shapers were missing, too - what McLaren call a fence, a longitudinal curve, and a spat, a sort of vertical, rectangular scoop-shape.All in all, Boullier, said the damage cost "20 points of downforce, more or less - so half a second a lap".Despite this, after changing tyres and front wing, Alonso returned to the race and lapped faster than team-mate Stoffel Vandoorne on all but a handful of laps.How did he get it back to the pits?Even getting the car back to the pits in the first place was something of an achievement, Boullier said. "The front tyre deflated straight away after turn three and then it takes some time before you lose the tyre from the rim," Boullier said. "The rear right tyre deflated I think around turn 15. "You can see [from the television footage] that after entering the pit lane, the car is not driveable, and actually he hit the wall on the right-hand side. "At that stage, he told us after, he did not know how to bring the car to the pit. He didn't know if the car would steer. He just tried to go straight on the fast lane and he thought he would leave it there and we would take it out [of the race]. "At the last minute, he turned and the car steered into the pit-stop bay. We made a joke with him and said it was the best positioning of the weekend. "He said: 'Let's change the tyres and front wing and go.' From the pit wall, I saw these flames all around the floor. The car was on fire."McLaren could not see all the damage, because the front floor is hidden by the aerodynamic shapers behind the tyres.So after checking the car was structurally sound and safe, they sent Alonso back out with new tyres and front wing. He spent a couple of laps asking what they could see from the data and whether they needed him to change any settings. It turned out that, while it had lost downforce and was theoretically slower, it felt OK to drive."Actually, the car was still more or less balanced, strangely," Boullier says. "The reason was there was this big hole in the front floor, so we lost downforce at the front and rear. So the car was not very well balanced, but it was still driveable. He didn't complain about anything, not even driveability."How did Alonso's performance compare with Vandoorne's? The Belgian was "struggling with his tyres more than usual," Boullier says, but Alonso finished two places ahead, and his average lap time was 0.521 seconds quicker, in a car theoretically 0.5 seconds slower.
Debris spills across the track as Alonso continues to drive his damaged carHow did Alonso do it?This is not the first time Alonso has over-achieved in a damaged car. In qualifying at the 2006 Italian Grand Prix, a rear tyre failure left his Renault with broken rear bodywork, but he went on to set the fifth fastest time - and faster than team-mate Giancarlo Fisichella in a healthy car. Renault's sporting director Alan Permane, then a race engineer at the team, said of that performance: "Half the car was ripped off. We measured the downforce he'd lost, calculated what that should have translated to in lap time, and he lost nowhere near that. It's like he sort of refuses to accept it."Now, Boullier says: "He has this facility to switch his driving style always to suit the car balance. He is one of the very rare ones. Depending on the balance, whether you have front [brake] locking, rear locking, straight away he adjusts his driving to not hurt the tyres. In that case, it helped him a lot."I compare him sometimes to a shark when it smells blood in the sea. Then it starts to chase. Fernando is the same. In that mode, he decided: 'Change the tyres, let's go back racing, just check the balance and tell me what I need to do if I need to change something.'"All weekend, actually, he was telling us: 'Nothing is important other than finishing the race. It is going to be chaos. We need to go through the chaos and finish the race and we will be in the points.'"I think that's why he came back saying: 'Change the tyres, change the front wing, don't worry, I am going to drive it like it is.'"Boullier believes that Alonso's mindset in these early races has been affected by the team's difficult start to the season, with a car far off the pace they were expecting. After justifying their decision last year to split with engine partner Honda on the basis that they had one of the best chassis on the grid, McLaren have joined forces with Renault only to find they are around a second lap slower than Red Bull, who use the same engine. Alonso has qualified 11th once and 13th three times in the first four races. McLaren's lack of pace has led to chief technical officer Tim Goss being removed from his post. Yet, in the races, Alonso has taken three sevenths and a fifth, and he is sixth in the drivers' championship. Largely thanks to him, McLaren are fourth in the constructors' championship.This, Boullier believes, has influenced the team as well. After all, they could have decided to retire the car in Baku, given the extent of the damage."Maybe we got conditioned as well by him all weekend saying: 'We need to finish the race; this is the key,'" Boullier says. "We also are in a different place. Qualifying pace is not our best and so we have shifted our mindset to: 'We need to grab any points we can.' And that means by any means we need to finish the race. "This is our mindset since Australia. We want to capitalise on the first four races and grab as many points as possible."Was it one of Alonso's best races?
Alonso is a two-time world champion having won the 2005 and 2006 Drivers' ChampionshipsDrives like this go down in F1 folklore. Ayrton Senna winning in Brazil in 1991 stuck in sixth gear for the last few laps. Michael Schumacher finishing second in Spain in 1994 stuck in fifth gear for much of the race. Or Alonso himself in Malaysia in 2010, struggling with a malfunctioning gearbox while battling with Jenson Button's McLaren.  Boullier has worked with Alonso at McLaren for more than three years, and before that they were rivals when the Frenchman was at Lotus - now Renault - and the driver at Ferrari. How does Boullier rate Alonso's race in Baku?"When you see the condition of the car, definitely it is one of the best ones," he says. "He did some other amazing things - some times when you feel he is in another world. "The consistency he had with the tyres and tyre degradation and managing the tyres, especially with the safety car and everything, and he did it. "Then, at the final safety car restart, we said: 'Oh my god, with the car he has, everyone is going to pass him.' But no." In fact, Alonso went on the attack, and took seventh place from Williams' Lance Stroll on the last lap. "He is a real fighter," Boullier says.
F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault at the end of 2017, joins the BBC team this season to offer insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors.The dramatic crash between Red Bull drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix was the result of an internal dynamic that does not exist at Mercedes or Ferrari.At the two top teams, you get the feeling that there is a number one driver and a number two - even if that is not the case contractually.
Although both Kimi Raikkonen and particularly Valtteri Bottas have improved this year, the continued success of Sebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton gives them a natural priority over their team-mates.At Red Bull, it's a very different situation, and Baku laid bare the size of the problem that creates for the team.Who is better? Verstappen or Ricciardo?They have an internal battle between two of the most talented drivers on the grid - some would argue the best driver pairing. But with that comes the intensity of each trying to prove their superiority in a fight that has been so close over the past couple of years.Verstappen is seen as the golden boy in the team. On the back of a fantastic run in the second half of last year, he got a lucrative multi-year contract extension, while Ricciardo did not.The Australian will have felt a bit of pain from that, as it clearly showed that the team's thinking, even if they did not say it publicly, was that Verstappen was their best hope for the future and they wanted to tie him in.I'm sure Red Bull would love to keep Ricciardo as well, especially after the performance he produced to win this year in China, but they have left the door open for him to leave. His future has become one of the key topics of conversation this year.The fight in Baku was for fourth and fifth places. Neither was going to finish higher than that unless someone else dropped out or there was contact. And there was no gain for the team whichever driver emerged ahead.From that point of view it was a relatively futile battle, for just two points. But the intensity of it belied that. It was a battle of egos, both desperate to assert themselves over the other.The build-up to the crash
Ricciardo turns the wheel left, after initially going right, committing to the inside for the slight gap he sees on Verstappen's insideThe way Ricciardo and Verstappen went at it was risky, astonishing and initially brilliant to watch.The tone was set by Verstappen's aggression early on. His overtaking move on Ricciardo into Turn Two at the safety-car restart on lap six laid down a marker. The problem was he then did not have Ricciardo's pace, and held him up for the next 35 laps.Many drivers in Verstappen's shoes would have taken a more cautious approach, especially as he had had incidents in every race so far in 2018, was a lowly eighth in the standings and needed to start bringing home some strong results. But Verstappen was as aggressive as I've seen him for a long time.Every time Ricciardo tried to pass on the outside, Verstappen would fly in from the inside, late on the brakes, his wheels locked up, fighting to the death to hold onto that fourth position.At one point, this even led to contact on the exit of Turn One, where the incoming barrier on the outside makes the track jink in on the exit. They were lucky to emerge from that unscathed.Verstappen's aggression came from the fact he is naturally a tough racer. He has always been fierce in wheel-to-wheel combat - not always getting it right, but always getting stuck in and not being afraid to trade a bit of paint with his rivals.What added an extra edge to this was the previous race in China. There, Verstappen had the race to lose, he was ahead of his team-mate on track after Red Bull made their decisive decision to change tyres behind the safety car. But a big error and a collision dropped him well out of contention and he was left to watch as Ricciardo swept to a brilliant victory.To see your team-mate do that well is painful as a driver, especially when you know it could have been you in their shoes, and that it's your own fault that it was not.After China, everyone was waxing lyrical about Ricciardo's moves and questioning Verstappen's wheel-to-wheel skills.Baku was a chance for Verstappen to prove on track that he is every bit a match for his team-mate, and his aggression showed just how much doing that meant.Who was to blame?
Ricciardo's dummy worked to move Verstappen slightly but at 350km/h he is aiming for a tiny gap, leaving zero margin for error or reaction from either driverIt was absolutely brilliant to see the dicing between the two. But every time they got close into Turn One, I was wincing, waiting for contact.Such was the two drivers' determination and willingness to risk, that the longer it went on, the more it seemed inevitable they would crash.Ricciardo looked to have made the decisive move when he finally overtook Verstappen on lap 35 around the outside into Turn One.It was a brilliant pass, Ricciardo at his very best, super-deep on the brakes, giving Verstappen no chance to come back. Ricciardo probably thought he had finally cracked his team-mate.So when Verstappen re-appeared ahead after their pit stops shortly afterwards, it would have been galling for Ricciardo. Stopping one lap earlier should have given Ricciardo the advantage, but the slow warm-up of his tyres meant he lost track position and had to do it all again.In my opinion, Verstappen was brave and maybe slightly foolish to be racing Ricciardo so hard for the first 40 laps.Equally, though, I believe Ricciardo was the braver, and potentially more culpable, when they collided to end their races.It's easy to blame Verstappen because of his history - years of aggressive, over-the-top defending, plus his difficult start to 2018, compared to Ricciardo's clean driving history and brilliant overtaking.But if people step back and analyse this incident in isolation, it is much more 50-50.Ricciardo tried to sell Verstappen a dummy. To an extent it worked, but then he fully committed his car to the inside, to the smallest of gaps, with a huge closing speed from which he could not bail out.This is at the end of a two-kilometre straight and is the highest speed on the entire calendar. To be fighting for such a small gap at 350km/h (217mph) is a huge risk that did not need to be taken.Initially, there was a slight gap there, but when Verstappen instinctively moved back to the left to shut it off, contact was inevitable.Technically, this was two moves to defend from Verstappen. And that is against the rules, which say a driver cannot move more than once to defend his position.Moving in the braking area to defend is a big no-no in F1 because by that time it's too late and the driver behind cannot do anything to avoid contact.In this case, the movement from Verstappen was a bit earlier than that and it was a tiny move to shut off a tiny gap that had opened on the inside. The moves were a matter of inches rather than sweeping across the width of the track, which is more what the rules are aimed at preventing.Verstappen's driving was questionable, but Ricciardo was too committed and I think too ambitious, the absolute definition of a do-or-die. And this time he got it slightly wrong.In Ricciardo's mitigation, it is easy to see that his team-mate's overt aggression throughout the race might have wound him up a bit too much and he got suckered into the move.All in all, I think the stewards were right to call it a racing incident. Ultimately, both were to blame. It was ambitious from Ricciardo, defending in a grey area on the limit from Verstappen. But when these two were fighting like that for 40 laps, I don't think many were surprised by the outcome in the end.
Red Bull have told Ricciardo and Verstappen their crash was "unacceptable"Where do Red Bull go from here?It begs the question what Red Bull will do now? Will they impose team orders or will they continue to let their drivers fight.Red Bull has become a popular team in this generation, especially with the arrival of Verstappen. They have two hugely talented drivers, maybe both future world champions, fighting it out tooth and nail, in a car that is still a fraction behind the top two teams.They often need a cavalier attitude to win races, and they have it at the heart of their racing. China was a great example - it was a bold call to pit on to new tyres at the end which won them the race. No other front-runners did it.Red Bull instil a sense of fun. Their attitude is feisty, give anything a go. It comes from the top down in that team and we love it.Probably every other team on the grid would have imposed team orders before the contact between their drivers in Baku, such was the intensity and duration of their battle.It is easy to admire Red Bull for not doing that. They put a lot of trust and faith in their drivers to fight it out cleanly between them. But this time it came back to bite, and the trust might not be there anymore.Team principal Christian Horner was as angry as I've seen him after a race and the drivers have already been ordered back to the factory to apologise to the 800-strong workforce in Milton Keynes.It was a humbling end to a brilliant scrap, but these two are young and will bounce back. They will surely be duking it out for titles in the future and this Baku battle may well be talked about years down the line as the moment the epic Verstappen-Ricciardo contest came to the boil.
Lewis Hamilton made the most of his good fortune to win the Azerbaijan Grand PrixMercedes Formula 1 boss Toto Wolff said after a pulsating, wildly unpredictable Azerbaijan Grand Prix that he felt this was developing into an all-time classic season. On the evidence so far, it is hard to disagree.In four races there have been three different winners from three teams. Each event has been fascinating in its own way. The past three have been thrillers. And in all of them there could have been at least one different winner had things worked out in another way.The two big beasts in the two main teams are separated by only four points at the head of the championship. And while Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel are for now comfortably clear of the rest, it feels going into each race as if any one of the drivers from Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull could be potential winners.
Most critically, perhaps, the underlying pattern of the sport has changed, incrementally but fundamentally - for the first time since the start of 2014, the out-and-out fastest car on the grid is not silver, but red.Hamilton wins thriller after Red Bull crash Red Bull crash 'unacceptable', says boss Bottas deserved to win - Hamilton 5 live F1 race review'It was par, on average, and a couple of bogeys' Hamilton needed his win in Baku badly, after a generally underwhelming start to the season from him and his team and no victories for the world champion since the US Grand Prix last October.Not only had Hamilton not won, he had been distinctly off form since dominating the opening race in Australia before a team miscalculation saw him lose victory.In both subsequent races in Bahrain and China, Hamilton was the slower Mercedes driver in qualifying, and in Shanghai team-mate Valtteri Bottas out-raced him, too. 
Hamilton is off the mark having not won since the US Grand Prix in 2017 - Usain Bolt will be pleasedHamilton did manage to qualify ahead in the end in Baku, but it was again a far from convincing performance through the practice days, and the same could be said of the race.He chased Vettel in the opening laps after the pair had converted their front-row slots into first and second places, but it looked like the German was just playing with his rival, managing his pace and stretching the lead only when he needed to. Hamilton said he felt the same.Hamilton was nevertheless giving it his all, trading fastest laps about four seconds behind the Ferrari, before a lock-up into Turn One on lap 22 - caused, he said later, by a sudden switch from a 25km/h headwind to a 15km/h tailwind - cost him more than four seconds.As things turned out, the race came back to Hamilton, through the late safety car, an error by Vettel and then a puncture for Bottas. It gave him the championship lead but he said he felt neither relief, nor justice for the win lost through no fault of his own in Melbourne.
"I don't feel unworthy of the win," Hamilton said. "I drove pretty well through the race. It was just for me, if my normal level is eagle, birdie, today was par, on an average, and then a couple of bogeys."Standing on the podium believing Valtteri should have been standing there; I felt like he had earned it. There have been days I have lost a grand prix and it has been gifted to someone else, and the happiness they would have, whether they had earned it or not they had fingers up in the air, you know?"I am wired differently. I could have done that because I still won and you take what you get. I like to win because I have outsmarted and outclassed the other driver."I am grateful for the win but performance-wise, not entirely (because of) me, but with the car, my performance didn't feel like it was on par with what I am capable of doing. I will take that away and try to come back and attack stronger in the next race."Mercedes and Hamilton have work to do If Hamilton has not been driving as well as he feels he could, so too are his team below the level they have been used to.Vettel led the championship at this stage last season, and the Ferrari was proving the better and more flexible race car, but never was it the out-and-out fastest on average in qualifying. Now it is, if only by a few hundredths of a second. Vettel has been on pole for three of the four races."Being in the lead of the championship is great," Hamilton said, "but if we were to continue on the trajectory we are on it would take weird races to keep us in the mix. But you can't rely on those for the next 17. "We need ultimate performance and confidence in the car. I have the pace in me and so does the car but both of them are not in perfect synergy. We have to improve in lots of areas.
"We definitely are there in the mix and we've not got a terrible car at all, by any means. We've just got to refine it a little bit and make it a little bit easier to drive. She definitely isn't as easy to drive as last year."A lot of work has been done, but we are still, performance-wise, behind them. "I don't think we're under any illusions that we have the fastest car or that we don't have work to do. We know that. Everyone's working as hard as they can but we've really got to keep pushing. "I've got to figure out how to get on top of this car a little bit more. Australia, as I said, I was really comfortable with it and since then I've not been and I don't really know why. So I've got to try and work on that."Are Ferrari now favourites? 
Only four points separate Vettel and Hamilton in the race for a fifth championship titleIt has been a season of races that have got away from drivers who could - or should - otherwise have won. Hamilton in Australia. Bottas had some regrets in Bahrain that he had not pushed Vettel harder, and again that China had slipped through his fingers to Ricciardo's stunning rise on fresh tyres.In Baku on Sunday, Vettel probably had most reason for regret, having dominated the race from the start only to lose out to a safety car then his own mistake in trying to wrest the lead back from Bottas at the final restart, locking his wheels, damaging his tyres and slipping down to fourth.But Vettel exuded the relaxed air of a man who knows he is driving well in the fastest car."I am not worried at all," he said, "because it is quite different to last year when in qualifying we were not competitive enough for most of the year and then later in the year we were not competitive enough to make things happen. The car is there and we need to make sure it stays there."On performance, Ferrari and Vettel have to be considered favourites at this stage, but Vettel is more than aware of the manner in which Mercedes got on top of a difficult car last year and steamrollered him in the second half of the season. And he does not want that to happen again.Bottas driving his way to a new contract 
Hamilton acknowledged team-mate Bottas deserved to win in BakuBottas exudes the languid calm of so many Finnish racing drivers but he was distraught to have lost a race he felt was his in such agonising fashion.Uncharacteristically, he did his television interviews in sunglasses and, asked how he would pick himself up, he joked: "Maybe 10 pints would do it."Bottas had appeared destined for a distant third for much of the first part of the race, as Hamilton and Vettel duelled at the front, but then, as Wolff put it: "Valtteri's race came towards him."Listen: Bottas' race-ending blowoutAs Hamilton then Vettel made their pit stops, Mercedes left Bottas out, hoping to snooker Ferrari strategically in the way the Italian team had done to Hamilton in Melbourne. It worked beautifully."Valtteri just kept going faster and faster and faster," Wolff said, "to the point that even with no safety car we thought there was a chance because he would have switched late to the ultra-soft tyres and tried to hunt Sebastian down. But then obviously it all started."The Red Bulls crashed, the safety car came out, and Bottas had stayed far enough ahead of Vettel following the German's pit stop to mean he had time in hand to stop himself and come out still in the lead. 
Bottas wrote on Instagram after his heartbreak in Baku: "sometimes the sport you love can be tough."From there, all he had to do was fend off Vettel at the restart and the race was his. And it would have been had he not hit the debris on the pit straight.The loss will hurt for a while, but the bigger picture is much more positive for Bottas. His championship chance may already realistically be gone - he is 30 points behind Hamilton, and he must realise he will probably have to play a support role before too long. But he looks to be driving his way into a Mercedes seat in 2019.His contract runs out this season and Wolff has made it clear he will take the first half of the season before making a call in the summer. But if Bottas continues to drive like this there is no reason to change him for either Daniel Ricciardo or Esteban Ocon, both of whom crashed out on Sunday. Certainly Hamilton wants Bottas to stay. "He is more than ever earning his place here," Hamilton said. "Give him fair dues; he has risen to the challenge. He is doing a solid, solid job, more than the team would need."Can Red Bull prevent all-out war? 
Red Bull have told Ricciardo and Verstappen their crash was "unacceptable"Wolff does not need a lesson in the risks of having two thrusting, aggressive, equal number ones after presiding over three years of bitterness between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, but he got it anyway thanks to the Red Bull drivers on Sunday.The team put on a news-management masterclass after the two had taken each other out, but despite the carefully constructed message of apology and contrition, and the insistence it cannot happen again, it may not be that easy to control.The racing between the two was fast and furious in Baku and they touched more than once before the final collision, when Ricciardo smashed into the back of Verstappen after the Dutchman defended in his usual borderline-acceptable fashion.Red Bull might want to allow them to race, and insist they give each other space. But primacy in the team - and ego - is at stake.To avoid a recurrence, both will have to row back on their standard approach to racing with each other - Verstappen on his tactic of changing line under braking, which all other drivers feel is beyond the pale, Ricciardo on those uncompromising late lunges that secured the win in China.It remains to be seen whether that is a realistic aim, or whether what happened on Sunday is merely the latest step towards what some feel might be an eventual realisation - either by one of the drivers or the management - that having them both in one team is ultimately untenable.
Max Verstappen came fifth at the Chinese Grand Prix, won by Daniel RicciardoRed Bull have two drivers in their garage.One is widely tipped as a future world champion; the other's immediate future remains up in the air.One is regarded as one of the most exciting attacking drivers on the grid; the other's style seems to slip under the radar.
Max Verstappen often seems to steal the headlines at Red Bull but did Daniel Ricciardo's win in Shanghai prove he is the team's star man?Who is best in attack?When Verstappen signed a new contract last year, team principal Christian Horner said: "Max is right to be hungry for success and we are looking forward to extending that journey with him in our hunt for Formula 1 world championships."As we now look to the long term with Max, he is in the best place in the sport to build a team around him to deliver our shared ambition."Any favouritism has been denied by both Ricciardo and Red Bull, and the drivers have very similar records with the team.
Ricciardo has six wins in 82 races since joining, Verstappen has three wins from 40.Dubbed the "Master Overtaker" by F1 driver and BBC pundit Jolyon Palmer, Ricciardo earned his sixth in China in stunning fashion with a series of attacking moves. The highlights were his passes of Lewis Hamilton and the manner in which he scythed his way down the inside of Valtteri Bottas for the lead at Turn Six when it seemed as if there was no room to do so.Attacking flair is something associated with Verstappen but Ricciardo does not seem to win boring races - as the Australian has pointed out himself.All six of his wins have come when he qualified outside of the top three on the grid and had to work his way through.Verstappen's erratic drives
Comparisons between the pair seem even more relevant after the Dutchman was at fault for a crash with Sebastian Vettel in Shanghai, his second collision with a title contender in as many weeks.Afterwards, Verstappen admitted he needed to think about how to end a run of error-strewn races but said he did not need to calm down.However, he has developed a reputation for causing accidents during his relatively short F1 career.He has been forced out early by collisions or spins in just under 10% of his 63 races, compared to 2% of 132 races for Ricciardo.Verstappen was at fault when the pair came together on track as team-mates at the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix. That resulted in two memorable comments from Ricciardo - first, his "was that who I think it was?" team radio message, then his post-race description of Verstappen as immature.The Dutchman may be eight years Ricciardo's junior but, as Vettel pointed out after Shanghai, Verstappen is "not young any more" in terms of races in an F1 drivers' seat.AnalysisAndrew Benson - chief F1 writerIn Ricciardo and Verstappen, Red Bull have the strongest driver pairing on the grid - each of them would be in most people's top five, along with Fernando Alonso, Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.Ricciardo was many people's pick as the best on the grid in 2016, all things considered. But Verstappen shaded the intra-team battle last year, and who wins this time is one of the most intriguing questions of the season.So far, it has been the Australian who has shone brightest - especially through his brilliant win in China, while Verstappen has made a series of mistakes. Yet there is still a sense that Red Bull is becoming Verstappen's team - there is little secret that the Dutchman is the chosen one of the soft drinks giant's motorsport chief Helmut Marko.Ricciardo faces a big call this year, at the end of which he is out of contract. Does he leave, assuming there is somewhere at least as good for him to go, or stay and fight for supremacy with Verstappen?So far, the tensions of having two A-listers under one roof have been kept more or less under control. Whether that would be the case if Red Bull were to emerge as title contenders with two such closely matched drivers remains to be seen.
Of the 42 overtakes in Bahrain, Hamilton's was undoubtedly the pick of the bunch.What happened?Hamilton started ninth on the grid after a five-place penalty for a gearbox change in his Mercedes.He made a great start and speared between the Force India of Esteban Ocon and Renault's Nico Hulkenberg in front of him, but chose to back off and play safe before the first corner and finished the first lap ninth.A virtual safety car period to recover the retired Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo paused the race, and after the restart Hamilton swept past Fernando Alonso's McLaren on the pit straight before - seemingly with the braking zone fast approaching - deciding to dive past both Ocon and Hulkenberg into the first corner.Running sixth by lap five, Hamilton passed Kevin Magnussen's Haas a lap later, then Pierre Gasly, and moved into fourth by lap eight, before finishing third after Kimi Raikkonen's retirement.Vettel wins spectacular Bahrain GPRaikkonen retires after running over mechanic'Quite risky' - what Hamilton said"It is not an easy manoeuvre to pull off - it was quite risky," said the Briton."I tried to be cautious. I had a lot of people ahead and a long race. I was trying to take it easy, but lost a lot of ground at the start and was trying to come back."'He breezed past them all'Ex-Renault Formula 1 driver Jolyon Palmer on BBC Radio 5 live sports extraThis is brilliant for him. The race has unfolded perfectly for him after a tough start.

This is how Formula 1's official Twitter account marked Hamilton's moveFive of the best - stunning overtakes from the pastMansell vs Piquet - 1987 British Grand Prix
Nigel Mansell (left) takes on Nelson Piquet in 1987Ask Nigel Mansell if driving at your home grand prix helps you discover energy reserves that you didn't even think you had, and he would agree.The 1992 world champion produced some magical moments in front of the British fans, none more so than his ruthless hunting down and stunning overtake of Williams team-mate Nelson Piquet at Silverstone in 1987."That race was just pure dynamite," said Mansell. "The fans were getting into it. I could see the fans stand up every time I went round. It meant so much to me and you could tell how much it meant to them."Mansell famously chased down Piquet's 29-second advantage before producing a breathtaking overtake on the Brazilian with two laps to go, selling him a dummy before diving down the inside into Stowe Corner."It was like a chess game and I was doing maths for the last 28 laps thinking, 'If I do X amount of qualifying laps, can I find 29 seconds and catch him? And then if I catch him, is there enough time to pass him?'" added Mansell.Alonso vs Schumacher - 2005 Japanese Grand Prix
Fernando Alonso and Michael Schumacher (right) tussle at the 2005 Japanese Grand PrixFernando Alonso is the sort of special talent who is both capable and brave enough to go where few other drivers dare go.That was very much the case in 2005 when a young Alonso not only took on Michael Schumacher but did so at one of the most challenging corners in Formula 1, Suzuka's famous 130R.Alonso had been running nose to tail with Schumacher for several laps before finally grasping the opportunity to strike, sweeping around the outside of Schumacher at full speed - 207mph - to put himself on the way to a third-place finish.Mansell vs Berger - 1990 Mexican Grand Prix
Nigel Mansell (right) passes Gerhard Berger at the 1990 Mexican Grand PrixSome moves are so good even the driver who does it can't quite believe it happened.Mansell's manoeuvre at the 1990 Mexican Grand Prix was one of those.The Briton once showed his fearless streak with a 300km/h (186mph) pass on Gerhard Berger around the outside of the hugely intimidating Peraltada corner on the penultimate lap to take second."I think, did I really do that?" said Mansell. "Because in that day if it went wrong, you were going to get seriously hurt. So you've got to be a bit mental to take it on."Crazy or not, the fans loved it and the corner was renamed 'Mansell's corner' in his honour before the 2015 Mexican Grand Prix.Hakkinen vs Schumacher - 2000 Belgian Grand Prix
Mika Hakkinen (left) got past Michael Schumacher (right) with the help of backmarker Ricardo Zonta (middle)At the 2000 Belgian Grand Prix, Mika Hakkinen pulled off one of the greatest overtaking manoeuvres in F1 history to win from Michael Schumacher.The German led coming into Les Combes on the 41st lap and in the way was Ricardo Zonta's BAR-Honda, which the pair were about to lap.Hakkinen said: "I thought to myself, 'Whichever way Michael goes, I'll go the other.' He went to the left, so I went to the right, braking as late as I dared, off-line, on a still-damp track, at 300km/h (186mph). As I turned in, I had done it; I had passed Michael."Hakkinen finished first, with Schumacher second, although the German would beat the Finn to the world title.Ayrton Senna vs Alain Prost - 1988 Japanese Grand Prix
Ayrton Senna (left) went on the inside to get past Alain ProstIn the Japanese Grand Prix of 1988, Ayrton Senna stalled on the grid but recovered to be involved in a spectacular battle with McLaren team-mate Alain Prost.On a wet surface, Senna got past his rival with a brave move down the inside that enabled him to win the race and become world champion.While it may not seem to be one of the higher-risk passes, given what was at stake it was beautifully executed and we would eventually realise just how rare it would be for Senna and Prost to actually get around each other without it ending in a title-deciding shunt.
F1 driver Jolyon Palmer, who left Renault at the end of 2017, joins the BBC team this season to offer insight and analysis from the point of view of the competitors. Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas will be heading to the Chinese Grand Prix this weekend with contrasting emotions after their intense battle for victory in Bahrain on Sunday.Vettel produced a masterclass in race management and composure in his Ferrari to take his second win in succession this season, eking out his soft tyres for 39 laps.
Mercedes' Bottas, meanwhile, admitted he ended the race "disappointed" not to have snatched victory from Vettel. And I suspect he will head to China for the race this weekend thinking it was a race that was his for the taking.Bahrain was an incredibly tense, nervy race between two teams - and ultimately two drivers - which came right down to the wire on the last lap as Vettel just fended off Bottas' attack to win.Did Bottas bottle it?
Bottas (left) came off second best to Vettel (right)I've been in situations like Bottas was in.In my case, it might not have been for a grand prix victory, but in any situation where a chance presents itself and you don't take it, as a racing driver you can't help but think of the missed opportunity. You relive the moment - in Bottas' case the first corner of the last lap - and think, 'What if I'd have dived down the inside?'On balance, the Finn had a great weekend in Bahrain. He outpaced team-mate Lewis Hamilton in qualifying, which is no mean feat, and did a strong race to hunt down Vettel, managing his pace and tyres well throughout. Bottas is an extremely good driver, as I also mentioned in my column after the Australian Grand Prix. But I wonder if he lacks a killer instinct in wheel-to-wheel racecraft.If Vettel had been defending from Hamilton on the last lap - and certainly if he had been defending against either of the two Red Bulls - I'm sure he would have faced some sort of attack down the inside.Daniel Ricciardo has shown time and again that he is willing to lunge up the inside of anybody, none more notable than against Bottas in the US Grand Prix last year. In that race, Ricciardo threw the car down the inside from an unfathomable distance. At the first attempt, the Australian ran off the track and Bottas re-passed, but next time Ricciardo made it stick.Bottas had the chance to do the same to Vettel in Bahrain.In Short: 'Bottas isn't good enough for MercedesWhy Bottas should have gone for itI'm not a fan of big run-off areas on these modern circuits, but one of the benefits is if you go into a corner too hot you can just run wide and return to the track. In many cases this is frustrating to watch as a fan, and the drivers also prefer the challenge of having gravel or barriers closer, where mistakes get punished. But if Bottas had committed down the inside he either would have emerged from Turn One with the lead and the win, or he would have gone in too deep and ended up having Vettel slide back underneath him and ultimately finished second. At least that way he would know he had given it a go.The only way such a move would end in tears is if he was half-hearted and stuck just a nose down the inside. That's where collisions so often happen. Note how few times Ricciardo actually makes contact with another driver, despite his amazing overtaking bravado. He commits so heavily to his moves that they either come off, or he overshoots the corner too much and loses the place again. There's so rarely a half-hearted attempt from him, and I'd say he's the true master of the art.Once shy, many times bitten
Drivers earn reputations in F1 in wheel-to-wheel racing. As a driver you take into account who it is you are fighting with before deciding to defend, attack, chop or lunge. For example, I always knew if I was fighting someone like Kevin Magnussen he would be an extremely tough opponent and not give an inch even when we were team-mates!Magnussen had another fantastic weekend, finishing in a well-deserved fifth place, but yet again got stuck in, having contact with Renault's Nico Hulkenberg on lap one, before more with Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly on the restart after the virtual safety car.He was perhaps slightly lucky to get away with both of those with a car still intact, but these moments cement his reputation as a feisty racer, and people are a bit more cautious about passing him as a result.Fernando Alonso, of course, is another example of a driver you know will never cede a position without giving 110% to hang on to it if at all possible. And if you see a Red Bull in your mirrors, you know they will have a lunge as soon as possible because of the nature of their two aggressive drivers.That means you sometimes defend unnecessarily and end up getting distracted looking too much in your mirrors, handing the advantage straight to them.I feel Bottas has the reverse effect in F1 at the moment. Yes, he's had a few scrapes, most notably with countryman Kimi Raikkonen, but he's seen as something of a soft touch in wheel-to-wheel fighting. Drivers are throwing moves down the inside of him that they wouldn't try on Hamilton in the other Mercedes, for example, because they know Bottas would rather let them through than risk a crash. Of course this is true to some extent with most drivers in championship contention, but the others simply drive a bit closer to that risk.Bottas' non-attempt at a move on the final lap may have been borne out of a natural caution and a willingness to finish second which many others around him wouldn't have. He made matters worse by being caught in two minds and ending up in the middle of the road into Turn One, making his exit harder and letting Vettel off the hook at Turn Four as well, the next best overtaking place on the circuit.Bottas is an incredibly talented driver, but if he is to really take the fight to those around him I feel he needs a bit more bite in the heat of battle.His Bahrain weekend shows he has the pace to win races and fight with the best. He now has a strong haul of 18 points after two races and that keeps him within reach of the championship protagonists.But perhaps it could have been seven more from Bahrain and more from Melbourne as well if he had made more progress from 15th on the grid.Considering Hamilton's ability to hustle Vettel in Australia, it's conceivable Bottas could perhaps have done more.Having said that, it's early stages in the season and at least the pace Bottas showed, and his charge at the end, will give him confidence heading to China this weekend.Vettel at his best
Hamilton and Vettel have won seven out of the last eight championships between themIf Vettel's victory in Melbourne two weeks ago was somewhat fortuitous, Bahrain was a heroic drive. Pole to win seems so easy on the face of it, but in reality this was far from it.After struggling throughout practice and qualifying, Mercedes were more than a match for Ferrari on race pace, and once Bottas jumped Raikkonen off the line we were all set up for another Mercedes v Ferrari showdown.Although Vettel led the first stint, Mercedes put Ferrari on the back foot by switching to a one-stop strategy with both cars, forcing the German to eke out his 'soft' tyres for 39 long laps.What followed was an absolute masterclass in race management and composure. Vettel declared after the race that the tyres were finished and this was evident from the time sheets.As Bottas closed in at the end it seemed inevitable he would take the win on the fresher tyres but Vettel used all of his cunning to keep the last bit of life in his tyres and maintain just enough distance to the man behind.There is no more desperate feeling for a driver than being chased down like this in the final laps. You are in a strong position, doing the absolute most you can with what you have, and someone is hunting you and making massive inroads into your advantage.When Vettel was told Bottas' pace towards the end of the race was over a second a lap quicker than his, he said he did the maths and it didn't look good that's an understatement to say the least.It's a horrible feeling. But he kept his head down, focused on his job and did it perfectly. One mistake and Bottas would have snatched this race away from him. Despite Vettel's luck in Melbourne, it was a drive that means his championship lead is fully deserved.

Highlights: Simpson holds off Woods to win Players
Tiger Woods provided more evidence he is ready to return to the winner's circle with his stirring weekend at the Players Championship.TPC Sawgrass belonged to champion Webb Simpson, who brilliantly controlled this prestigious tournament, but it was Woods who dominated most conversations in the aftermath.Having made the cut on the mark at one under par, the 42-year-old former world number one had weekend rounds of 65 and 69 to climb into a share of 11th place.
"What I saw this weekend makes me excited. It could be incredibly close," said former Open champion David Duval.Jordan Spieth, Woods' playing partner in the final round, said: "He'll win sometime soon enough. He's certainly playing well enough to do so."And having emerged from last year's career-saving back fusion operation, the man himself is clearly imbued with regenerated confidence."There's no way I would have predicted I would be at this point at the beginning of the year," Woods said."The way I was just coming back and just trying to get a feel for it and then hopefully have a schedule. I didn't know. But now I feel like I've got my playing feels and I'm playing tournament golf and I've got it. I'm not that far off winning golf tournaments."It certainly looked that way during much of the weekend at the Players Championship, a tournament featuring the top 50 in the world with the exception of the injured Paul Casey.Woods started this year ranked 656th in the world. He is now up to 80th, with a stated aim of making it to the last World Golf Championships event at Firestone in August."One of my goals is to get into Akron, one last time, before we leave there," he said."I've won there eight times and I would like to get there with one more chance. But I've got to do some work between now and then, hopefully put together one good event."
Tiger Woods shot six birdies in the final round of the Players ChampionshipSo how likely is a Woods victory in the near future?The power and fitness are there for all to see; on Sunday he fired an imperious tee shot 354 yards on the treacherous 14th at Sawgrass.But it is what happened immediately afterwards that leaves cause for concern. It was time to push, to apply one last burst of pressure on runaway leader Simpson.Woods had 110 yards to the pin, he belted a 60 degree wedge, only to see the ball spin back off the front of the green. He couldn't get up and down and the bogey eliminated any chance he might have had.In his pomp, Woods' competitive instincts would have ensured no such inaccuracy would creep into his game at such a vital moment. It was that mental strength that separated the 14-time major champion from the rest.The killer instinct is still missing, just as it was in the Valspar Championship in early March, when he was runner-up to Casey. Woods chose a long iron off the 72nd tee when surely it was time to go for broke with the driver.But, make no mistake, he is surpassing all expectations and is in good shape to be contending for titles through the summer months. Last Saturday, he was eight under for his first 12 holes. On the Sunday, he covered the same stretch in six under. It was scintillating golf and he attracted galleries standing eight deep all around every hole he played.Duval told Golf Channel viewers in the United States: "We've all questioned what is the top for him in this comeback? What can his body do, what can his new golf game do?"Having had the opportunity to speak to him about it, we were all in a hurry to judge what was going on. I sat up here and said let's give him the starts, let's give him the summer, let's give him the year, let's see if he can gain some of the freedom he needs."Well, it looked to me this week that he regained that freedom. I watched the club pass the body through the downswing, watched him maintain his spine angle through that process. "He hit some monster tee shots, incredible iron shots and the freedom with which he did that we just hadn't seen."Duval, a former world number one who was Woods' first genuine rival in the pro ranks, believes the rejuvenated American has to maintain a busy playing schedule."The question is when is he going to play again? I hope he plays sooner rather than later," Duval said."I hope he doesn't go home and just hit golf balls. I want to see him play rounds of golf under tournament conditions and expose himself exactly like he did this weekend."Because he did that and he performed. There were a few hiccups but that's the game of golf."Woods has yet to tell us when he will next be competing, but Jack Nicklaus' Memorial event in Dublin, Ohio - starting on 31 May - would seem the logical choice in the build-up to next month's US Open.Wherever he shows up, Woods will generate a big buzz. We could feel it at the Players Championship, and what he did there will only feed a growing sense of anticipation across the golfing world.

Harrington recalls Carnoustie triumph
When Padraig Harrington talks about the storied 18th hole at Carnoustie he sounds like a man describing some of kind of medieval torture chamber, a seventh circle of hell reserved for golfers. "Out of bounds left off the tee, water left, water right, water short, bunkers straight in front of you," he explains. "All the complications off the tee that you can possibly think of. "The second shot, you can hit the green and go out of bounds. We've seen that many times. It's the most difficult closing hole in major championship golf and probably in world golf. 
"I could play it 100 times in a row and still be as nervous and excited on the 100th attempt as I was on the first."Harrington was back in Carnoustie on Tuesday, sizing the place up ahead of the return of The Open in July and sharing some stories of the day in 2007 when he won his first Claret Jug here in a play-off with Sergio Garcia. What turbulence he went through that afternoon."It was the first time in my life that I felt embarrassed on the golf course and the first time in my life that I won a major championship," he recalls. "All sorts went on." Catalogue of carnage at CarnoustieIf you want to present a case for Carnoustie being the most brutal test in major golf then Harrington is a key witness, but far from the only witness.The closing stretch; that murderously difficult run from 15 through to 18, has traumatised the world's best from its first staging of The Open more than 80 years ago. Jean de Velde in 1999 is, and always will be, the poster boy for Carnoustie's destructiveness, but there are so many others.
The Open: Jean van de Velde's 18th hole disasterIn 1931, when The Open was first staged there, Carnoustie-born Mac Smith just needed to par his way in from 16 to win. Double bogey on 16 and another double on 17 ended his hopes. "I felt rather as if I had gone to see a man hanged," wrote Bernard Darwin, the doyen of golf writers of the time.That same year, the little Argentine, Jose Jurado, took a five-shot lead into the final round but blew up. He walked off 18, retreated to a small room behind the first tee and, wrote The Scotsman, "cried like a child". He didn't speak about it for decades. Eventually, he broke his silence. "For maybe 20 years I thought about it constantly," he said. "Usually at night I'd be woken up by memories of Carnoustie."Harrington is standing beside the 18th green and is holding his Claret Jug from 11 years ago. He won a second a year later at Birkdale and won a third major, the USPGA, the same season.  "When somebody comes into the house and sees the Claret Jugs there's a reverence towards them," he says. "They're looking over at them and I can see they're looking and I can see they want a picture."It's a really nice reminder of what it means. It's one of the joys of life that people get excited about it. I had the USPGA trophy, but everybody pushes it aside to get a picture with the Claret Jug. It's amazing how iconic it is. People see it and their eyes light up."When Harrington recounts the story of how he won in 2007 it's like being on a rollercoaster. On the Sunday, he was playing beautifully. He'd got through 15, 16 and 17 with a one-shot lead. A par down the last and Garcia would have needed to find something very special to catch him.'I got a moment of doubt on the top of my backswing'
Harrington was the first Irishman to win The Open in 60 years back in 2007"When I'm confident I sometimes jump up on the tee thinking I'm bulletproof - and I was feeling bulletproof that day," he says."I was going to bust it down the middle. Everything was great. I got a moment of doubt on the top of my backswing, only a small amount of doubt but it felt extreme because I wasn't expecting it. "If I was standing on the tee with a little more fear, I would have been ready for the self doubt and I would have handled it. I hit a terrible drive."Into the Barry Burn he went. He had 238 yards to the green. A 4-iron. "Extraordinarily difficult. Wind off the right and all the danger that I talked about earlier," he says. "I was just trying to carry the Barry Burn and let it run up to the front of the green. I hit another bad shot - and I was devastated."The tee shot was bad, but, hey, you get on with it. Plenty of people hit bad tee shots on 18 at Carnoustie. The second shot was me throwing away The Open. "In that moment I was sure I'd just lost my chance. It was my Open. I was one ahead, I was playing great, it was mine to lose and I felt like I'd lost it. "It was one of the few times in my whole career that I felt like I'd choked. I would have been happy for the ground to open up and swallow me. I was going to throw in the towel."Enter Ronan Flood, Harrington's friend and caddie. On the walk to the burn Flood hit Harrington with positivity. 'It's not over'. 'One shot at a time'. 'Let's finish this out'.
US-based Harrington, 46, is currently ranked at 214 in the world"Every cliche under the sun," he remembers. "I think he took the 4-iron off me because I would have hit him with it. He was resilient, though. Other caddies might have moped and shown their devastation. He must have felt terrible as well, but he didn't let on. "I can say, categorically, that in those moments he won me The Open championship. By the time we got to the burn I was listening to him and I was back in the zone."I had a chip shot of 49 yards to the pin and I hit it like a teenager showing off, a low, hard, spinny one. The whole crowd thought I'd mis-hit it and knifed it over the back of the green but in my head I was saying, 'Watch the spin on this'. "That chip was purity. The putt, a six-footer, was the opposite, it was a grind, a nasty one. I just willed it in. When I holed it for a double-bogey it hit me again that I'd just lost The Open."'I stopped feeling like I was a loser'Then came his sliding doors moment. Young Paddy Harrington, aged three-and-a-half, was standing at the back of the green with his mum, Caroline. She had him on a tight rein until the putt dropped. Then he made a run for it. Everything changed there and then."As I walked off the green I saw him running on," says Harrington. "I picked him up, gave him a bit of a twirl and at that moment in time I stopped feeling like I was a loser. There's your son and when he looks at you he's not judging you. It definitely helped change my mindset. Somebody still loves me."It was a huge change in my momentum. It was just the way he looked at me, or the way I felt he looked at me. It brought me back to where I needed to be. I wanted to be miserable, but he wasn't having any of it."
Harrington shares a moment with son Paddy after holing out for a double-bogey at the 18thHarrington remembers retreating to the recorders' hut to watch Garcia play 18. The Spaniard had an 8ft putt to win The Open. "I wasn't sitting there going 'Miss, miss, miss' and when he did miss I never got a change of emotion from it. I was sitting there thinking, 'I am going to win this Open'. "Now, logically, he had to miss for me to have a chance of winning it, but I'd convinced myself that I was going to win, I didn't go out for the play-off thinking, 'Amn't I lucky to be in a play off, happy days'. It's amazing how badly people approach play-offs. I was on an even keel. Business as usual, 'I am going to win this somehow'."'There's a lot of things that might have been different'Over the years he's been asked what might have happened had Garcia's putt dropped instead of missing by a millimetre. "People ask if it was life-changing to win, because I managed to win two more majors on top of it," he says. "I don't know about that, but I think losing might have been career-changing. If I'd lost it could have put me into reverse. It would have been a big loss, a hard one to take."The drive I hit on the 72nd hole has damaged my driving ever since. Can you imagine if it resulted in me losing the tournament? There's a lot of things that might have been different that we will never know about."Eighty-seven years ago, Edinburgh's Tommy Armour won The Open at Carnoustie. "I've never lived through such an hour," he said in the aftermath of the mayhem that unfolded. Harrington, more than most, would have known what he was talking about.Playing 18 again on Tuesday morning, this time just for fun, he smashed a perfect drive down the middle, avoiding the bunkers and the burn and the out of bounds. "Now if only I'd done that 11 years ago I'd have saved myself an awful lot of grief," he jokes. Leaving the tee box he smiled the smile of a survivor - and a champion.
Matthew Fitzpatrick, seen here playing a shot on the seventh hole during the first round of the Players Championship, now lives in FloridaBritain's four-time European Tour winner Matthew Fitzpatrick is competing in this week's prestigious Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass in Florida. The 24-year-old from Sheffield, who carded a level-par 72 in the first round, shares his insights in his diary for BBC Sport.My scorecard looks a bit boring with just one birdie and one bogey but I really feel I deserved a better score than 72.A two-under-par score would have been a much better reflection because I had six birdie chances inside 15 feet, which is pretty decent.
But I just putted awfully. I had a couple of good up and downs but got some bad breaks as well.The funny thing is whenever I have played here in the past the greens have been lightning fast - and that was great because I love putting on quick greens. This week they seem really slow and I've not adapted to them.I feel like to get it past the hole I've really got to smash the ball, then before you know it you've got four feet coming back. Anything that was scoreable distance just wouldn't go in.World number one Johnson shares lead at SawgrassPlayers Championship: Will Sawgrass event become a major?In my previous diary I stressed the importance of accuracy from tee to green and that's the big cause for satisfaction after this round.The one bogey, on the first - my 10th hole - was very unlucky. My drive ended up semi-plugged in the face of a fairway bunker. The face was only about an inch tall and it was right up against that - three inches either way and I could have got a full club on it.I played with one of the guys at the top of the leaderboard in American Chesson Hadley and the big difference for him was that he kept holing the putts. He played solidly and every chance he had he took. He carded eight birdies, which is pretty impressive round this place.The thing that pleased me most was my attitude. I've come back off a break after the Masters and Harbour Town last month and I really wanted to be more relaxed on the golf course. That was really good today, so that's a positive.I only had the one bogey so there wasn't too much to get down about. In the second round I need to stick to my plan: play smart.Looking at the scores, the cut is likely to come at one under par. So I need the putter to warm up, get myself into the middle of the pack and take it from there.
McIlroy desperately wants to win the Masters to complete the Grand SlamIf nothing else, Rory McIlroy has stirred up a delicious debate with his assertion that the Masters is "the biggest tournament in the world".The 29-year-old from Northern Ireland toned down last week's initial comments that he did not care about The Open and the US Open, but stands by his belief that, among the majors, the Masters is "a notch above the others".Ranking the standing of tournaments is a delightful exercise for all golf fans and in that spirit I feel compelled to respectfully disagree with McIlroy. It is sure to be a topic of discussion in Wednesday's latest edition of The Cut, the BBC golf podcast.
This is especially the case in the week of the Players Championship at Sawgrass, a massive tournament that strives to sit at golf's top table alongside Augusta, the Opens and the US PGA Championship.The Cut podcast: Has the Open in the players' hearts and minds? It is easy to see why McIlroy rates the Masters so highly. It is the one major to have eluded him and the tournament he most wants to win.  That appetite can only have been further increased in the wake of squandering an excellent chance of landing a first Green Jacket last month.
Masters 2018: Patrick Reed holds nerve to beat rivals and win Masters
The Augusta National gets pretty much everything just right. Their immaculate course is the only one that stages a men's major every year.Tradition and history are at the heart of a tournament that constitutes golf's most glamorous week. And the fact that it is eight months since the most recent major further stokes the sense of anticipation everyone feels at Augusta every April.Furthermore, it is the most elite and exclusive major field of them all. Only the best in the world, former champions and the odd invite from Asia - where Augusta wants to spread its global footprint - get to play the Masters.Golf's greatest player, Jack Nicklaus, has six Green Jackets. Tiger Woods, the man who has arguably played to a higher level than anyone else, is a four-time winner.The tournament continues to identify champions of the highest calibre. In the past five years, each winner has been ranked inside the world's top 12 at the time of their triumph.But is the Masters the biggest tournament in the world? It may be for McIlroy, but I would still put The Open at the very top.The original and the best?
American rookie Ben Curtis won the 132nd Open Championship at Royal St George's in 2003, ranked 396th in the worldIt is the original major, the one - they say - that leaves us with the "Champion Golfer of the Year". Whoever triumphs has conquered not just a great golf course but a field drawn from all over the world.They have also contended with conditions far more variable than we ever see at Augusta and it is played on a seaside links, the original form of golf that requires imagination and a multi-dimensional set of skills.The Open can be won by a player ranked as low at 396 in the world, as Ben Curtis proved in 2003.A 59-year-old great can still contend in this form of the game, as five-time champion Tom Watson showed at Turnberry in 2009.And 40-somethings with the guile and craft of years on the golfing treadmill, such as Darren Clarke and Ernie Els, can take down the young tyros.The statistics show though that the Claret Jug is more likely to fall into the clutches of the world's elite - as Nicklaus, Woods and, indeed, McIlroy have proven.Despite all the advances in technology, golf on the British seaside remains as relevant as ever. The Open produces stellar champions and in the past five years the average world ranking of its winners is 8.2 - the lowest of the four majors.All these facets help make The Open the greatest golf tournament in the world - and what is more, unlike the Masters we can all go and watch it. The US Open, traditionally the most attritional of the majors, is the United States' national championship. It carries huge prestige, but too often the story is the course rather than the player.  That would be number three on my list, with the US PGA Championship fourth - although that is the only one of the quartet to have been won by a reigning world number one - McIlroy in 2014 - in the past five years.The fifth major?If that is a metric - and it is worth considering - the Players comes into the picture because twice during this period the world's top player of the moment has won at TPC Sawgrass. Woods was world number one when he won in 2013 and Jason Day was top dog two years ago.However, this week's defending champion Si-woo Kim was ranked 73rd when he completed his shock victory 12 months ago.
Highlights: Kim wins the 2017 Players Championship
The Players is the PGA Tour's flagship event. It claims to have the deepest field in golf and they will be chasing $11m (£8.1m) in prize money this week, a fund that sits alongside the majors.The tournament has its own place in the golfing firmament with the punishing layout that includes the famous island green on the par-three 17th.But the fact is golf has only four men's majors, then comes the Players.It will be interesting to see how the standing of the majors alters with the upcoming calendar changes. The US PGA Championship is moving from August to May from next year and will no longer be the last one on the calendar.Traditionally the fourth of the big four in terms of date and standing, it will feed off the buzz generated by the Masters, while the Players switches to its old March date.This could add to its lustre because it will be the first big-name gathering with true resonance since The Open the previous July. However, it has to guard against being lumbered with the tag of being a pre-Masters warm up.One element remains unarguable. Whichever of the big four it is, the golfer who wins will have etched themselves into the history of the game.The Players can't quite say that with the same certainty, but it is not far off.
Tommy Fleetwood and Chris Paisley finished tied for fourth at 19 under during the Zurich Classic of New OrleansWatching Tommy Fleetwood's reaction to playing partner Chris Paisley holing out for eagle to complete a fine performance in New Orleans fully vindicated the PGA Tour's format change last week.Paisley called his pitch to the bottom of the cup at TPC Louisiana "the coolest moment I've ever experienced on a golf course" after Fleetwood charged over to embrace and celebrate with his Zurich Classic partner.This was the second year of the event being a team competition, with the players pairing up to play fourballs and foursomes. And while it works well some of the attendant hype is way out of tune. 
Undoubtedly, the format brings out personalities and sporting tension, adding a welcome new dimension to the staple of 72-hole strokeplay.The decision to make the final round the more demanding foursomes alternate shot format also worked. It put players under the cosh, having to perform for their partner with the title on the line.  How the format worksFoursomes: Teams of two compete with one ball per team, taking alternate shots until the hole is completed.Fourballs: Each player has their own ball, and the team's lowest score on each hole counts.As Paisley's ball disappeared, it was little wonder that fellow Englishman Fleetwood beamed with such delight. He knew his day's work was done with his mate having just helped each of them land $216,900 for finishing tied fourth behind Americans Billy Horschel and Scott Piercy.But while the format was a hit, the decision to use walk-up music on the first tee, surely, missed by a mile. It is symptomatic of the game trying too hard to modernise itself.The notion that songs piped through a loudspeaker can enhance a golfing experience is hard to fathom.The European Tour has used tunes on the range at several events. The thinking is that it somehow makes the experience "cool".  This is so far off the mark. The reason fans love watching players on the range is to watch them hone their technique and to admire the unique sound of a perfectly struck ball.The music gets in the way and it must be remembered Coldplay is not cool golf. The sport should have the self-confidence to say it can be "cool" without musical accompaniment.Last weekend seeing Alex Cejka and Ben Crane head-banging to Whitesnake's 'Here I Go Again' before teeing off their third round was a step too far."I think it's awesome," Crane stated. "It's super fun. Yeah, I think guys should be required to do something."Cejka, added: "A lot of guys, like the Australians we were playing with (Greg Chalmers and Cameron Percy), they were standing there like everybody else. A little bit boring. 
Billy Horschel and Scott Piercy won the Zurich Classic of New Orleans with a final-round five-under-par 67 after starting the final day three shots behind overnight leaders Kevin Kisner and Scott Brown"We're crazy characters, so for us it was normal, you know? Everybody is different. Some guys might like it, some guys don't."Cejka concluded: "It was cool." Crane added: "It was very cool."Really? It left this stuck-in-the-rough observer feeling distinctly cold to the idea.   Thank goodness PGA champion Justin Thomas and his partner Bud Cauley didn't make the cut (the music was only there at the weekend). Their choice was Elton John's soporific Circle of Life."It was a team decision," Thomas admitted. "It's hard to pick a pump-up or walk-out song for a shot you are hitting a hybrid or a three wood on."Getting pumped up didn't really do a lot of good, so we just figured we would have some fun with it."At least it was a decision based around golfing performance and that has to be at the heart of any tournament experience. Olympic champion Justin Rose poked a bit of fun at his playing partner Henrik Stenson by playing Spandau Ballet's 'Gold' - the Swede won silver in Rio - but while music and hullaballoo can work in a stadium environment golf courses are not those kind of venues.We have debated this topic further in this week's The Cut BBC Golf Podcast - which can be downloaded from the BBC Radio 5 live section of the website, or the golf homepage - and we also look ahead to another event where there will be a full-on assault to our senses, The GolfSixes at The Centurion Club near St Albans on 5-6 May.Like the New Orleans tournament, this European Tour event is a welcome shift with the emphasis on pace of play, teamwork and playing for your country.Last year the golfing side was fascinating. The use of a shot clock on one of the holes led to the players calling for the time limit to be reduced from 40 to 30 seconds.It looked a viable golf equivalent to Twenty20 cricket and it undoubtedly has potential. Where it fell down was with the razzamatazz, the music and awful commentary.A golf course is no venue for dry ice. These are usually beautiful places, don't obscure their majesty with artificial clouds of fog, incongruous music and intelligence insulting announcements.Golf lends itself to all sorts of entertaining formats and these are the proper vehicles to provide much needed innovation to the game.  US tour player William McGirt believes last week's PGA Tour pairs event could be further enhanced by introducing a round of Texas Scramble. Players would play their next shot from whichever is the most advantageous position achieved by the previous stroke.McGirt reckons teams could shoot 19-20 under-par in such rounds. "Maybe play fourball and foursomes the first two days, make the cut, have a scramble to either tighten things up (on the leaderboard) or spread it out," he said.Why not? It would remain a genuine test of golf especially if you finish the event with the more demanding foursomes, as was the case last week.GolfSixes is also played with an alternate shot format, greensomes, where the players choose which of their drives they want to hit from.  It is fun and will be further enhanced by the inclusion of female teams for the first time.As long as the golf takes priority and it is not dragged down by too much surrounding phony hype, it is a format that can prosper. It needs to because big-money backers are required to attract the biggest names and without them it has no viable long-term future.With all such initiatives it should be remembered the coolest thing is the golf. Just ask Tommy Fleetwood and Chris Paisley.

Masters 2018: 'New kid on the block' Reed wins 2018 Masters
Amid all the talk of estrangement in the wake of Patrick Reed's Masters victory there emerged another tale of separation to fascinate followers of professional golf.While discussion of Reed's troubled family background dominated the post-Augusta headlines, another nugget surfaced when he did the US talk show rounds clad in his new green jacket.The 27-year-old, whose gutsy triumph yielded his first major title, revealed his greatest win had been achieved with a handpicked set of clubs.  
Unlike the vast majority of his leading rivals, Reed played with a mixed collection rather than a uniform set prescribed by a lucrative deal with a leading manufacturer."The biggest thing was I wanted to be different," Reed told the business network CNBC when asked about leaving his club deal at the end of last season. "It's hard to believe there is one company that makes 14 perfect golf clubs and a perfect golf ball for every player." Listen to The Cut podcast: Reed's Masters win and Rahm's rise towards the topThere are not many leading pros who would publicly say such a thing.Taken at face value, this suggests the most unusual aspect surrounding Reed is not the fact he does not talk to his parents, but that he is a professional golfer prepared to eschew huge riches from an all-encompassing equipment contract.
Reed's caddie Kessler Karain carries a carefully selected bag of clubs for his manFor his Masters breakthrough the American had Ping, Titleist and Callaway gear in his bag as well as Artisan wedges.  It was a bespoke assembly aimed at maximising his comfort around Augusta National."This has freed me up," Reed added. "On the equipment side, I'm just out there doing my thing. I'm using whatever I want to use."I'm able to put 14 golf clubs and a golf ball in the bag that I feel are the perfect fit for me. To do that and come out with my first major, it was a risk. But it was a risk that was the right one."It is a refreshing approach, a break from the commercial normality of the professional game. For fans, it is surely more authentic to know a player is using a certain club or ball because they like it rather than for vast financial gain.The elite players receive millions to play exclusively with the clubs and balls of a certain manufacturer and to then tell us they are competing with the best equipment they have ever used.  Others may have deals where the majority of their bag is from one firm and they supplement it with drivers or putters of their choice. It is not unknown for the headcover of the sponsoring manufacturer being disingenuously used to conceal a driver from a rival company.Listen: The Cut podcast - Masters 2018 reviewAt every level, commercial interests permeate the paid ranks. It is an inevitability, of course, but players become clothes horses for the biggest sponsors and sporting apparel enterprises.And while this set up provides financial security, it also erodes individuality and character. How do you spot a pro golfer in the street? Chances are an incongruously pale forehead provides the giveaway clue.No matter how wealthy they become, it seems every player is ready to cash in on cap deals that lead largely to uniformity, anonymity and a two-tone head.This is despite many preferring to play without headgear when they have the choice. They are not obliged to wear any kind of hat at the Ryder Cup and many choose to go without.With obligatory peaked caps largely absent in the biennial matches between Europe and America, we get a much better idea of their characters. Although they are wearing a team uniform, their individuality is much more apparent.
Bubba Watson is easy to spot on the course in his neon pink high-top shoesClose your eyes and think of some of the great characters of golf - Seve Ballesteros, Jack Nicklaus, Sir Nick Faldo and Greg Norman. I'd wager the images you carry of these titans does not involve them wearing headgear. Even those who did don a hat in days gone by, did so with a sense of individuality - Ben Hogan's flat cap being a prime example.Nowadays the players reject such choices. Robert Rock seems to be the last European Tour star unencumbered by headgear after Tyrrell Hatton lived up to his name by putting one on to spread the commercial word while swelling his bank balance.Other exceptions would include the unorthodox Bryson DeChambeau, who borrows from Hogan's sartorial playbook and Rickie Fowler, who dons a wide-brimmed cap to separate himself from the rest.Throw in Bubba Watson's pink 'high-tops' to match the vibrant colour of his driver and you have more or less covered the full gamut of golfing individuality.It is largely parked for financial gain and Reed is ironically actually a prime example. He was required to ditch his usual red and black final-round outfit for the Masters at the behest of his clothing sponsor.They did not want it to clash with the traditional Sunday attire of Tiger Woods, their number one star.Nevertheless, Reed ultimately proved pretty in azalea pink. And the smiling eyes beneath his distinctively white forehead told a story of how the policy of using his own tools, if not clothes, worked out so well at Augusta.It gave him the green garment every male golfer would choose to win.

The first Test against Pakistan is England's first since Ed Smith (left) was appointed national selectorEngland v Pakistan, first TestDate: 24-28 May Time: 11:00 BST Venue: Lord'sCoverage: Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 LW and the BBC Sport website. Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Full tour detailsEngland stand on the eve of a really important summer.They will want to continue their excellent progress towards a home World Cup next year, and in Test cricket they have to find a team that can both win at home and compete away - beginning with the first match against Pakistan at Lord's on Thursday.After a bruising winter - coming a distant second best in the Ashes and then more disappointment in New Zealand - England not only have to win, but also find a way to develop into a more rounded, all-conditions outfit.
That is a tricky task, especially given the relentless nature of their schedule. Trips to the uncomfortable surroundings (in cricketing terms) of Sri Lanka and the West Indies follow this winter, with the chance to win back the Ashes from Australia in 2019.Not only that, but there are question marks over some of the senior players because of form or longevity.There is a lot that captain Joe Root, coach Trevor Bayliss and new national selector Ed Smith have to work out in a relatively short space of time.I will play without pressure - Bess on possible Test debutListen again: Tuffers & Vaughan Cricket ShowEngland's preparation is not good enoughWe have been speaking about the same subject for two or three years, maybe longer. If you look at England's preparation for Test cricket, home or away, it is not good enough.They are not getting enough good quality experience of conditions when they are on tour and, even though at home they can say, 'we have played three or four rounds of County Championship cricket', those matches at the extreme ends of the season are not adequate build-up to a Test series. The early part of an English summer does not provide a player the opportunity to push his Test credentials.At the moment, we have all this talk of 'The Hundred'. It would be so nice to see English cricket devote that sort of time, effort, manpower and money into making the Championship the best possible breeding ground for Test cricket.Allied to this is the problem that English conditions do not easily allow England teams to prepare for playing away from home. For example, very rarely do you need to play two spinners in England.And so England's dilemma is this: they have to improve results, but at the same time move the team forward and create a depth in the squad that will serve them well in the winter.Ideally, England will win at home, but win the hard way. We want them to make big totals, to bowl teams out in tough conditions, to have to battle into the fifth day. We do not want them conning themselves with wins on a fresh, green pitches against subcontinental teams.  That won't convince anyone that England have turned a corner and are ready for Galle, Colombo, Antigua or Jamaica.That is not a criticism of English conditions. I love to see the ball move around and it is good for visiting teams to come here and be tested.But we don't want to see matches that are deliberately loaded against the away team.
Scrapping toss would make for boring cricketI cannot believe that people are seriously considering supporting the idea of doing away with the toss in Test cricket and giving the choice to the visiting team.That would result in the most bland, benign pitches and therefore the most boring cricket you could imagine, because no home team will want to be caught out batting last on a dry pitch that is starting to turn.I'm staggered that the International Cricket Council is giving it a moment's consideration and I'm really disappointed that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has decided to support it.I feel really strongly about this. I firmly believe that the excuse being made about pitches being to blame for home teams winning so many Test series is a cover for the lack of preparation that visiting teams undertake.If away sides are given proper preparation in the unfamiliar surroundings, they would cope far better than if they squeal that pitches are being rigged.In fact, pitches are not being rigged. I haven't seen a rigged pitch in ages. They weren't when England lost in India and they certainly weren't in Australia. The problem is visiting teams are simply not giving themselves enough time to get used to them.To potentially ruin Test cricket by playing it on pitches like roads is not the answer. It's a smokescreen to cover the real problems.Administrators do not want longer tours because they want to make money from one-day tournaments. That is the reason why touring teams are struggling, not rigged pitches.Even Superman couldn't do Bayliss' jobI've been wondering all winter how Bayliss, or any other person, can do the work that is required in the summer of 2019. How can one man produce a World Cup-winning side and an Ashes-winning team all by himself? That has always seemed like an impossible and unfair workload.Bayliss has to either devote energy to the one-day team for the World Cup or the Test team for the Ashes. I don't see how one man can do both properly. That is something the ECB will have to sort.Yes, it is a big summer for him because England have been a declining force in Test cricket under his stewardship and any decision taken on his future may come down to results produced against Pakistan and India.But even Superman couldn't be expected to do both jobs properly. It is a really difficult situation for the Australian.Big summer for big namesIt is not only Bayliss who is facing an important couple of months. The bigger names in England's team are also at crossroads of varying importance.It is an important time for opener Alastair Cook, who needs runs after a winter that produced only one innings of note.Stuart Broad improved in New Zealand and James Anderson has been excellent for the past year, but they have to show that they have it in them to get through a difficult winter and reach their target of next year's Ashes. They have enough in the tank, but these things can sneak up on you quite quickly.Root will be desperate for an improvement in his team's results. It's fair to say that this England team have not changed much since he took charge a year ago and now, with the Ashes behind him, perhaps he can start to mould it in his image.I don't think people really understood when I said I would have preferred Cook to stay on as captain through the Ashes, then allow Root the chance to bed in over this summer.As it turned out, Root took a battering over the winter and, for all of his confidence, that was not a great experience for a captain in his first year on the job.The selections of Jos Buttler and Dom Bess are exciting, a step in the right direction with an eye on the future. It is a positive sign.'Buttler brings flair to Smith's positive England'
England recall is like another debut - Buttler
Don't underestimate PakistanEngland should beat Pakistan. But they should not be underestimated. In all my talk of poor preparation, they have actually prepared well for this Test, including a win in Ireland.With Pakistan, we know to expect the unexpected. They are talented and frustrating in equal measure. They have not drawn any of their past 20 Tests, so matches they are involved in are unlikely to be dull.In Mohammed Amir, they have a wonderful fast bowler who has put a troubled past behind him and has the ability to cause England serious problems.The first Test of the summer, at Lord's, with the sun set to shine, really is quite an occasion. It should be one to savour.Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Stephan Shemilt.
England play a two-Test series against Pakistan before hosting India later this summerEngland v Pakistan, first TestDate: 24-28 May Time: 11:00 BST Venue: Lord's, LondonCoverage: Ball-by-ball Test Match Special commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra, Radio 4 LW and the BBC Sport website. Live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app. Full tour detailsStick or twist? That's the dilemma facing England's new national selector Ed Smith before the first Test of the summer against Pakistan.England endured a difficult winter - they were winless in seven Test matches against Australia and then New Zealand - and there is still debate over what the side's best batting line-up is.The squad is set to be announced on Tuesday at 15:00 BST and, with that in mind, we asked you to select your England XI for the first Test, which begins on 24 May at Lord's. 
More than 50,000 of you chose your team. The 11 most-selected players make up the team and they are listed here in batting order.1. Alastair Cook - picked by 85% of usersDespite his struggles in New Zealand - he finished the series with a 23 runs from four innings - an overwhelming 85% of people still want Cook to open the batting.2. Mark Stoneman - 43%Stoneman faces competition from Middlesex's Nick Gubbins and Surrey's Rory Burns when it comes to opening, but 47% of those who selected him saw him batting in the top two.3. Joe Root - 98%Whereas before the Ashes, people favoured a move up the order for Root, now 53% of those who picked him see his place at four, compared to 43% wanting him at three. In this final team, however, he is the most likely candidate for the number three spot.4. Dawid Malan - 80%Users were split on where Malan should bat: 35% of those who selected him saw his place at five, 23% wanted him at four and 18% placed him at three.5. Jonny Bairstow - 99%The first name on the team sheet! Wicketkeeper Bairstow is a popular choice in the middle order after making two centuries during England's miserable Test winter.6. Moeen Ali - 45%It was a difficult winter for Moeen, and he lost his place for the final Test in New Zealand to Somerset's Jack Leach. But he narrowly edges out the left-arm spinner here, after Leach was placed in 39% of users' teams.7. Ben Stokes - 96%Stokes is your most popular choice to bat at seven, with 57% of users placing him there, hence why he is below Moeen in the order here. His highest Test score - a superb 258 against South Africa - came at that position.8. Chris Woakes - 70%Woakes took 10 wickets in five Tests during a testing winter, but he comfortably makes the cut - and 37% of users want the all-rounder at number eight.9. Stuart Broad - 93%A slight change of action benefitted Broad massively in New Zealand - he took 11 wickets in two Tests at an average of 18.54, including 6-54 in the first innings at Christchurch. There is no doubt over his place in the BBC Sport readers' team.10. Mark Wood - 40%Pace bowler Wood returned home early from the Indian Premier League to stake his Test claim, and he just takes the final spot after his return to red-ball cricket in New Zealand.11. James Anderson - 95%England's leading Test wicket-taker is, unsurprisingly, the favourite to lead the side's bowling attack. Just don't mention the hair dye.Who missed out?Leach, who made his Test debut against New Zealand, only narrowly missed out on a place in the XI. He has, however, since been ruled out by a broken thumb.James Vince, the most recent incumbent at three, was picked in 25% of user's teams, while Rory Burns, who made 193 against Worcestershire last week, was in 20%.Lancashire's Keaton Jennings, who has six Test caps, was named in 15% of user XI's and Middlesex's Nick Gubbins 10%.My England teamWho should be in England's side for the first Test against Pakistan?

Jos Buttler has a strike-rate of 155 per 100 balls in this season's Indian Premier LeagueJos Buttler's recall to the England Test side was a telling statement from the man now in charge of picking the team.Ed Smith, England's new national selector, gave us an immediate insight into his thinking by choosing a batsman who has not played a Test for 18 months, who averages only 31 in Test cricket, and who has not featured in first-class cricket this season.I know from my time working with Ed in the Test Match Special commentary box that he is a man who likes flair players - he is a big fan of tennis player Roger Federer, for example.
Buttler certainly fits into that category. Smith described him as "one of the outstanding talents in world cricket", and Buttler's inclusion in a 12-man squad for the first Test against Pakistan starting next Thursday is a hugely positive move.He is in sensational form - he has scored 548 runs at an average of almost 55 in the Indian Premier League, which included a record-equalling five successive half-centuries.Anyone who has seen some of Buttler's innings in one-day cricket - he is responsible for three of the five quickest England hundreds in history - will testify to how dangerous he can be.There have always been doubts over whether he can translate that form into the Test arena, and this recall means he has got to knuckle down and show he has the technique and temperament for the longer form of the game.But this is a great opportunity to get him back in the side, and the benefit of picking him now is that he is absolutely brimming with confidence. He is on the crest of a wave.Buttler & Bess named in Test squadBess found out about Test call while in IkeaButtler adds depth as Root steps upButtler's inclusion as a specialist batsman at number seven means some reshuffling of the order.One of Mark Stoneman and James Vince had to go, and Vince's unbeaten 201 for Hampshire this week came too late.Vince has had plenty of chances and has looked the part at times, but he has simply not scored the runs - three fifties in 13 Tests and an average of less than 25 say as much.At number three, you have got to have a dependable technique, and we have not seen that from him.
Stoneman can consider himself very fortunate to keep his place, given that he has a highest score of 29 in seven County Championship innings this season. He is the one concern from my point of view. He must get runs - and he must get them soon.Captain Joe Root has made no secret of not wanting to bat at number three, but he has volunteered to do so for the good of the team. It is another positive move.Dawid Malan, who impressed over the winter, is more than capable at four, Jonny Bairstow will be fine to keep wicket and bat at five, and Ben Stokes at six makes for an impressive middle order.If they can get opener Alastair Cook scoring runs again, the batting looks in decent shape.Looking to the futureI also like the selection of Dominic Bess, the 20-year-old Somerset off-spinner.With Jack Leach, who played in England's most recent Test in New Zealand, sidelined by a broken thumb, they could have played safe by reverting back to Moeen Ali, a veteran of 50 Tests.Instead Smith has picked a player who has only 16 first-class matches under his belt, although a bowling average of 22 suggests he has talent.
It remains to be seen whether Bess will play the first Test of the summer at Lord's in what are traditionally seamer-friendly conditions, but his presence suggests England and Smith are looking to the future.After the Test series against Pakistan and India this summer, they tour Sri Lanka and West Indies in the winter, when spin will play a key part. It appears England are already planning for those trips.Given that Bess has taken only one wicket this summer, the selectors have clearly seen something in his attitude on the county circuit and with the Lions. I know he is a strong character.There was much talk when Smith was appointed that England selection would become much more heavily influenced by statistics.However, judging by my time in the commentary box with Ed, he is not a man obsessed by data. He just watches the players and game for what it is - and makes his decisions based on that.This is the sort of squad that I would have expected from him - both positive and forward-thinking.Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Justin Goulding.
Stuart Broad might be good at selecting a Fantasy Football team, but he lost to Lawro when he made his predictions against BBC Sport's tipster back in September 2015England cricketer Stuart Broad is a talented guy. He's England's second highest Test wicket-taker of all time, a dab hand on the golf course and is currently the top football manager in the world...well, sort of.We say that because Nottingham Forest fan Broad is top of the Fantasy Premier League table for the week, scoring 180 points - more than almost six million players.
He led with 169 going into Thursday night's final game of the week between West Ham and Manchester United, when a clean sheet for Hammers goalkeeper Adrian sealed his winning score.
Broad's team is top for the week, ahead of 5,906,070 other players
But where does it rank in Broad's list of sporting achievements? High, it would seem, with the cricketer saying he was "genuinely delighted"."I enjoyed 8-15 in the Ashes but leading gameweek 37 in Fantasy Football runs it close as a sporting achievement!" the Notts bowler, 31, said on Instagram before Thursday's match.During half-time he said on Twitter: "Fine half Adrian. Refocus after the break, it's a big 45 minutes for us!"Broad will receive a Premier League goodie bag for his efforts, although he is some way off the top in the overall standings - he is in 959,370th place.Broad's team: Ben Foster (West Brom), Jan Vertonghen (Tottenham), Marcos Alonso (Chelsea), Hector Bellerin (Arsenal), Jack Cork (Burnley), Leroy Sane (Man City), Raheem Sterling (Man City), Pascal Gross (Brighton), Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (Arsenal), Olivier Giroud (Chelsea), Glenn Murray (Brighton). Subs: Adrian (West Ham), Ahmed Hegazi (West Brom), Abdoulaye Doucoure (Watford), Kyle Walker (Man City).
Broad used the 'Bench Boost' option, which meant his entire squad, including goalkeepr Adrian, scored points

Ramos has a special bond with the fans - as he showed after the semi-final win over Bayern MunichIt was the moment that said everything about the relationship between Sergio Ramos and Real Madrid.There he was, the 32-year-old defender, veteran of more than 150 caps for Spain, winner of just about every honour in the game, in among the fans, singing and celebrating with them.The second leg of the Champions League semi-final between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich had finished half an hour earlier at the Bernabeu, the Spanish team through to their third successive final after a 4-3 aggregate victory.
The Grada Fans - the supporters' group who occupy the seats behind the South End goal - were still there and when Ramos heard, he and his team-mates left the dressing room to join them.Ramos jumped over the advertisements behind the goal, grabbed the microphone and led the remaining 2,000 fans to sing "Reyes de Europa, somos los Reyes de Europa!" (We're the kings of Europe!), a chant reserved for memorable Champions League victories.Ramos even started another Bernabeu favourite, "Cómo no te voy a querer" (How could I not love you).It was a moment that exemplified the deep connection he has developed with most Real Madrid supporters.Only a select few Real Madrid legends have managed to build such a remarkable emotional attachment with the fans.Ramos has reached the levels of forward Raul Gonzalez, who celebrated with a bullfighting routine, and even the much-missed Juanito.Juanito is a Real Madrid legend. Tragically killed in a car crash at the age of 37 in 1992, fans loved him so much that he's remembered on the seventh minute of every match at the Bernabeu with a song that simply consists of his nickname, "Illa, Illa, Illa, Juanito Maravilla" (Vel, vel vel, Johnny Marvel).His feisty temperament, his desire to win and love for the club saw the fans take him to their heart.It is now the same for Ramos, but it has not always been that way.The positional switch that saw Ramos rebornRamos arrived from Sevilla for 27m euros in 2005 when he was just 19."No defender in the world is worth all that money," Sevilla's president Jose Maria del Nido famously remarked after the transaction was complete.
Banners proclaiming affection for Ramos are regularly seen at the BernabeuRamos' lack of tactical discipline led a sizeable part of the Bernabeu faithful to wonder at first whether he was serious enough for Real Madrid. Always talented and impressively fit, something nonetheless seemed slightly off to the eyes of the average fan.Ramos spent most of his first six years at the Bernabeu playing as an attacking full-back.At times he starred in moments of glory - such as the sequence of comebacks at the end of the 2006-07 season that gave Real Madrid another La Liga title.But he was also involved in catastrophe - a good example being his defensive performance in the 6-2 defeat at the hands of Barcelona in 2009, where he chased the shadows of Thierry Henry & co.However, Ramos' place at Real changed forever in October 2011.Jose Mourinho used him as a centre-back in a match against Espanyol to cover for the injured Ricardo Carvalho.Ramos started the next seven matches in that position and Real Madrid conceded just once. "That was the key for Sergio to become the player we know today," said Fernando Hierro, another Real Madrid legend from whom Ramos inherited Real Madrid's number four shirt. "He'd played as a centre-back before, but just as a stand-in. Thanks to those few matches in a row, he started to develop a tactical awareness he didn't have as a full-back, gained importance in the central axis of the team, became more vocal with his team-mates. That move made him click." The move turned him into a more focused, dependable defender who became a leader at the back.Ramos is a natural leader, a characteristic that most of his coaches have been quick to highlight.Sevilla's Joaquin Caparros said: "You could see he was a leader since he was a kid."Former Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti even went a bit further: "Ramos has everything that Italian Paolo Maldini had: his persona, his technical skills, his ability to lead on and off the pitch."'A defender with a striker's soul'And then there are the goals.Lots of them and not just any kind of goals, as Ramos has always found a way to score a few every season. He's now reached 77 goals in his career, a number that could easily reach three digits before he retires.
Ramos has scored a series of crucial goals - scoring in two Champions League finals against Atletico MadridBut the latter years of Ramos's career has seen him score an incredible number of crucial, game-changing and, in some cases, season-defining goals.You could argue it all started at the Allianz Arena in Munich, in 2014, when Ramos scored two headers in the space of four minutes that saw Pep Guardiola's Bayern Munich lose another Champions League semi-final.Then came his memorable equaliser after 92:48 minutes of the final against Atletico Madrid that same season, the one that led him to tattoo '92:48' on his body."I'm thinking of starting him as a striker," said Ancelotti, only half-jokingly.Ramos scored again in the 2016 Champions League final against Atletico, and in the subsequent Supercup final against Sevilla, then in the Club World Cup semi-final and the final. Sergio Ramos - what he has won with RealLa Liga4Champions League3Super Cup3Uefa Super Cup3Copa del Rey2His equaliser at Barcelona's Camp Nou during a key La Liga match last season - another key goal in the dying minutes of the match - gave the team a much-needed draw to keep pushing for a title they would end up winning.That year saw Ramos score 10 times in 44 matches, remarkable numbers for a defender. "Ramos' goals are illogical, but football isn't logical," observed Ancelotti. The belief that Ramos will score when the team needs a goal most is the reason behind Ramos' tribute song at the Bernabeu."Si marca un gol, si marca un gol, si Sergio Ramos marca un gol" ("Yes, score one goal, yes, score one goal, yes Sergio Ramos score a goal" sung to the tune of 'When the saints go marching in').It is always chanted when Real Madrid are about to take a set-piece.Ramos describes himself as a "defender with a striker's soul", one that idolised no other than Argentine striker Claudio Caniggia when he was younger.The man who can break Liverpool's hearts?
Sergio Ramos with his wife - Spanish TV star Pilar Rubio - and two of his children after the 2017 Champions League finalRamos, a father of three who is married to the Spanish TV star Pilar Rubio, is far from perfect.He has been sent off 24 times, missed five penalties for Madrid, the latest just two weeks ago in Sevilla, and famously dropped the Copa del Rey trophy off the celebration double-decker bus, which then ran over it, back in 2011.But even his shortcomings have become positives in the eyes of the fans, since they are seen as by-products of his hunger to win and his authenticity. His affair with Manchester United, who almost signed him in the summer of 2015, becomes a case of "Sergio saw the light" among the fans and turned into another reason to root for the skipper.And in Kiev on Saturday he could further strengthen his bond with the club's fans if he can keep Liverpool's much-vaunted forward line in check.
Far from perfect, Ramos has seen red more than 20 times in his Real Madrid careerMohamed Salah will try to take advantage of left-back Marcelo's tendency to push forward.It will be left to Ramos, who plays alongside Marcelo in Real's back four, to cover for the Brazilian and take care of the Egyptian star. Ramos is not as fast as he used to be, and in a previous encounter when Salah played for Rome in 2016, the Egyptian showed that he was remarkably quicker than Ramos. However, the Spanish defender has improved positionally the longer he has played in the centre of defence and, according to his own words, he is not afraid of Salah: "He's just one of 11 players," Ramos said when asked about the striker. 
Salah, then with Roma, and Ramos have met before in the Champions LeagueZinedine Zidane's rotation policy has helped Ramos reach the end of the season in great shape, having been regularly rested in La Liga matches this season.And perhaps Liverpool's focus on Ramos should be further up the field.The defender has not scored in the Champions League since he struck against Apoel Nicosia in a group match back in September. But who would be against him scoring on Saturday?
Liverpool's fans quickly took the passionate Klopp to their heartsChampions League final: Real Madrid v LiverpoolWatch a special Radio Five Live programme at 19:00 BST on Wednesday, 23 May featuring Guillem Balague's interview with Jurgen KloppLive text coverage on the BBC website & Radio 5 live commentary of the Champions League final on Saturday, 26 MayOn Saturday night in Kiev, Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp will have his second tilt at winning a Champions League final.As his side face Real Madrid, arguably the biggest club in the world, Klopp will go through a maelstrom of emotions on the touchline, an animated figure who has taken Liverpool to the brink of a high not reached since that famous night in Istanbul 13 years ago.But when I caught up with him last week at Liverpool's training camp in Marbella, he was relaxed and insightful as he discussed the people who have shaped him and his career - as well as Saturday night's intriguing final.
Listen: The man behind the smile - Jurgen Klopp specialSergio Ramos - the Real Madrid man who can hurt LiverpoolThe highs and lows of this season's competition Quiz: Test your knowledge of this season's competition 'The pressure is relentless' - Lawro on the psychology of becoming European championsRecharging the batteriesThe previous occasion I was supposed to meet with Klopp was at Melwood, Liverpool's training complex.That got cancelled because he had to go to hospital, for something subsequently described to me as a 'precautionary measure'.There do not seem to be any issues this time as we sit by the pool, with Klopp cutting a calm and relaxed figure in the Spanish sun. But last week's trip was about much more than topping up the tan. "It isn't about bonding, because we are already bonded as a team," Klopp told me."It isn't even about the weather because we have that in England at the moment. But we need a moment together to concentrate our minds and our forces."Five years ago at Wembley against Bayern Munich, his Dortmund side fell just short of the finishing line as a late Arjen Robben goal won the Champions League for their arch rivals. Many felt an exhausting season and an exceedingly demanding coach had finally taken its toll. "Back home when we have the day free we dedicate them to doing all sorts of things and I just wanted us to have a few days together doing the absolute minimum."To recharge our batteries, do things well in training, have tactical meetings and all that sort of stuff. We need to go into the final with refreshed legs and minds."Klopp is preparing for the biggest match in domestic football as a man at the top of his sphere. But it has been a long journey for the 50-year-old. My dad? It was like living with a coachTo understand Klopp it helps to know where he is from and how he was raised.He was born in the sleepy, natural beauty of Glatten - a small town in the Black Forest, in the region of Swabia. According to Klopp it is "a great place to grow up, but a bit boring for a young adolescent".Klopp threw himself - or perhaps more correctly, was hurled - into the world of sport, by his ever demanding and sports-mad father, Norbert.A non-stop regime of exercise, drills and sport were put in place by Jurgen's father, who was desperate to see his son achieve the targets that circumstances and fate had prevented him from reaching.  Jurgen's two sisters, who had been the sporting focus of Norbert's attention prior to Jurgen's arrival, were relieved. Pressure on the girls stopped immediately and they were able to devote time to their favoured hobbies such as ballet and music.
Premier League Show: Jurgen Klopp interview
"It was most difficult for my sisters because they weren't particularly interested in sport," added Klopp."I had a good relationship with him - it was like having a trainer with you all the time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week."But it was not that difficult. He never punished me or anything like that. I have always said that all those things my father wanted me to do, I loved doing. That was my good fortune. Football of course, but I also enjoyed tennis, I never argued with him about that."Yet his dad hardly ever said "well done".He preferred focusing on the chances he missed instead of the goals scored, or the brilliance of one of his team-mates. Pushing his son was Norbert's way of being affectionate.Klopp in his own wordsI'm a totally normal guy, I came from the Black Forest. I'm the Normal One.With all these pictures on Twitter, it always looks like I am in restaurants and bars! I am not that type of guy.Whose idea was this to have two games in the semi-final?! Strange!The best word I can say to describe it [beating Manchester City] is: Boom!When I left school, the head said, 'I hope you can do something in football because, if not, I have not the best feeling for your future'.You'll never find me three days after a win, drunk in a hedge and still celebrating.People should not make me out to be like Jesus; I don't walk on waterYes, it's true. I underwent a hair transplant. I think the results are really cool, don't you?There is a Swabian proverb that says "to say nothing is praise enough". But if that worked for Norbert, it has not been adopted by Jurgen."Treating them (his sons) differently was easy because common sense is a big strength of mine," added Klopp. "I can explain problems to myself and come to a solution. That's how life is, you learn from your own mistakes or from the mistakes that other people are making, so that's what I did."Sometimes with my sons I had a reaction similar to my father and I thought 'whoah'. I realised it and stopped it immediately."Klopp's father died in 2000 after a two-year battle with cancer and shortly before his death pushed himself to the limit to play in one final tennis match with his club. He never lived to enjoy his son's managerial success.My future? I never doubted itKlopp never regarded himself as anything other than an enthusiastic but mediocre footballer, playing for little money in the fairly modest environs of second division side Mainz, with whom he spent a decade between 1990 and 2001.He had to supplement his semi-professional wages by working in a bar and also in a warehouse that distributed new films to cinemas.
Klopp made 325 appearances and scored 52 goals in 11 years with Mainz 05"It was clear from the start I was not going to have a great career," he admits."And I was playing in the second division and in those days not only did you not make much money but it was also so intense it took up so much of your time and kept you away from better-paid jobs."But I never doubted my future. That is very important. When they cut your Visa card in half because you do not have sufficient funds, it is not pleasant. But there is always a solution."  His intense upbringing had taught him about his limitations - but also his strengths."There's nothing in life I've been better prepared for than coaching. I have more capabilities as a manager than I had as a player."I started to coach when I was 20 with the under-10s and under-11s at Frankfurt and I loved the experience."
I don't want to be Liverpool manager at 70 - Klopp
With his ordinary playing career drawing to a close and with a family to feed, his passion for teaching and coaching nudged Klopp towards management.In 2001, at the age of 33, he was given the chance to manage Mainz.And he had one very strong trump card in his favour. At Mainz he played under Wolfgang Frank, the coach who proved to be his inspiration.My football style? The fist that opensFrank was at the helm of 16 different clubs and led Rot-Weiss Essen to the 1994 German FA Cup final (the DFB-Pokal), although they lost 3-1 to SV Werder Bremen at Berlin's Olympic Stadium.
Celebrating with the crowds after taking Mainz 05 to their first season in the BundesligaHe died aged 62 in 2013 but despite having very little success in terms of trophies or titles, Frank is credited with inspiring a renaissance in the Bundesliga that has inspired a new generation of managers including Germany coach Joachim Low as well as Klopp."When I started I wasn't learning anything about football that I like. It was all about 'how can we get the points?'" says Klopp."Wolfgang Frank inspired me not with his ideas of passionate football, but much more with his organisation. How to set up a team so you don't lose, because when I first became a manager we lost a lot of games."It wasn't about entertaining or a case of 'let's play football we can fall in love with' but about organisation, which is always the base from where you get the freedom to be brave." Frank sowed the seeds for the style of play known as 'gegenpressing' which, in its simplest form, effectively decrees that you have to win the ball back as quickly as possible once you have lost it.He played a back four without a sweeper - extremely unusual in Germany - and deliberately defended narrowly in certain areas of the pitch.Frank worked on the idea that your opponent was at its most vulnerable when it has just won the ball and was looking to do something positive with it. His teams would leave one or two players unmarked, encouraging the person in possession to pass to them. It was a trap waiting to be sprung.His tactics were an "epiphany" for Klopp, who was impressed by how "everybody had to go where the ball was. The aim was to create numerical superiority to win the ball, then sprawl out, like a fist that opens". Sound familiar?
Borussia Dortmund fans say thank you to their departing managerI asked Klopp if it is effectively organised chaos. He laughed, but his answer is serious. "Organised chaos sounds good always assuming the organised bit is coming from our team and the chaos from the opposition," he said."You can only do these sort of things when you have good enough players. The best coaches in the world do the things the players have given them the opportunity to do." Armed with Frank's tactics and a passion and commitment that has won the unswerving love of players, directors and supporters wherever he has coached, Klopp took Mainz to the German top flight for the first time in their history in 2004.He was at the club seven years, the same amount of time he spent at his next club Borussia Dortmund, where he won five trophies including two Bundesliga titles. It is the same period that, if everything goes well, he says privately he plans to be in Liverpool.My wife said 'Liverpool is for you'Liverpool, who appointed Klopp in October 2015, were drawn against his former employers Dortmund in the quarter finals of the 2016 Europa League.A 1-1 first-leg draw was a precursor to what many still feel is the greatest game ever played in the competition as Liverpool fought back from 3-1 down at Anfield in the second leg to win 4-3.Matched only in drama by what happened in Istanbul, Klopp started half-time by showing the players some videos of what had gone wrong in their first-half performance, and then he gave a rousing speech that referenced Liverpool's dramatic turnaround against AC Milan in Turkey.Klopp's managerial statsClubYears managedWinsDrawsLossesMainz 052001-20081097883Borussia Dortmund2008-20121796970Liverpool2015-present814429Klopp told the players to "create something that we could tell our grandchildren one day", and according to Liverpool striker Divock Origi, the manager's aggression from the touchline in the second half made a huge difference.Germany defender Mats Hummels later admitted Dortmund "started bricking ourselves" at the sight of Klopp creating a positive atmosphere in the ground.Liverpool were beaten by Sevilla in the final but by then the marriage between Klopp and the Anfield club's fans was established.Klopp is an unashamed lover of what is described in Germany as the 'English' game.Physical and uncompromising, 'heavy metal' football is also described using the German word "geil" by Klopp in Raphael Honigstein's biography of his compatriot. It comes with the suggestion that "self-sacrificing toil could be a sensual, arousing experience". The Kop has totally bought into this concept.Phil Thompson, who spent 13 years at Anfield, recently interviewed Klopp for Liverpool TV.Klopp told him that it was wife who said to him: "Jurgen, if Liverpool FC come for you, that is for you." It explains, too, why he turned down Manchester United.
Manic celebration after a late win against Norwich in 2016 and the glasses were goneThompson added: "He comes in, he understands the people, the people understand him, they see his passion and I think that is a very, very important part of what it is to be part of this club."There is an English core to Klopp's squad with Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Adam Lallana, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Joe Gomez, Nathaniel Clyne, Dominic Solanke and Danny Ings joined by other bright young British talents such as Scotland's Andrew Robertson and Wales' Ben Woodburn.Surprisingly - albeit partly because of injuries - there are only two Liverpool players in England manager Gareth Southgate's World Cup squad.They have thunderous weapons in attack while Klopp added composure in defence when he brought in Netherlands defender Virgil van Dijk in January, a signing that helped the side finish fourth in the Premier League and reach the Champions League final. The final? It will be a huge struggleKlopp will now try to do with Liverpool what he came so close to achieving with former club Dortmund. Victory against Madrid would be the culmination of the meeting he had in the law offices of his new employers on 1 October 2015, when he told them Liverpool should, and could, be a regular force in Europe.He added that his aim was not just to get them back to that elite level but to transform them into the kind of team no-one wanted to face.Job done, or at least part of it."The fans have been waiting so long for this and there is talk of nothing else in Liverpool," Klopp told me."We have had so many brilliant moments together this season and enjoyed every second of the Champions League so we can now get together to finish things off in a brilliant way."We will do the very best we can. We are in a good place at the moment and everyone knows how much I appreciate the efforts our fans are about to make to be a part of this party."As our chat comes to an end, I ask him how he can prepare to face an unpredictable team like Real Madrid, who offered up more than a dozen good chances against Bayern Munich in their semi-final yet still went through."It's a game of football," he replied."Sure we have the chance to win. We are going to have to work hard for it because it is the final of the Champions League."But if anyone thinks it will be easy for either of the two sides then they are mistaken. It's going to be a huge struggle for both teams. Brilliant! Bring it on!"
Tracy Moore and her 11-year-old son Freddie Elsom are embarking on another "mum-son adventure" following their trip to Basel in 2016A Champions League final against Real Madrid is a pretty big deal and some diehard Liverpool fans are willing to do just about anything to get there.From couch-surfing with the locals, to risking your own honeymoon, and detours through Scandinavia - the road to Kiev is proving to be more complex than most anticipated.BBC Sport spoke to some Reds fans who are going to extremes to see their team play in Ukraine on Saturday.
The Champions League final...via Sweden?
Rameez Tahir is travelling across four countries in four days in order to see Jurgen Klopp's sideFlight prices soared when the final was confirmed. Some fans opted to take direct chartered flights from Liverpool to Kiev. Others, however, will be facing a much lengthier journey...Rameez Tahir, 22, from Chesham, Buckinghamshire: I am travelling across four countries over four days: Sweden, Latvia, Ukraine and Lithuania and then back to London on Monday. Each trip one way worked out cheaper than the other flights to roughly a total cost of £610. Accommodation has been free due to the kind people of Ukraine opening up their apartments as part of the "Free couch for Kiev" Facebook campaign. I am also fasting for 19 hours a day due to the religious month of Ramadan over that period - like Mo Salah and Sadio Mane.John Dixon, 39, from Bebington, Wirral: I'm leaving on Thursday at 12pm. I'm getting the train to Glasgow from Liverpool Lime St, flying from Glasgow to Palanga in Lithuania, then hiring a car to drive to Vilnius airport - about three hours across Lithuania. Then we fly from Vilnius to Kiev, landing at 9am on Friday. We booked before the Roma second leg so paid £100. We don't return until the Tuesday after the game as anything else was too dear. The return is flying via Romania which was quite simple and was £200 for three of us the travelling this route. We all got lucky in the ballot and we are all 40 in the week before and after the game. Hopefully we will be celebrating with title number six!
Ricky O'Brien (far left), Danny McLaughlin (left), Luke Montgomery (centre), Neal Thomas (right) and John Dixon (far right) are travelling to Kiev in two groups - and are celebrating birthdays along the wayTom Whitehead, 22, from Heysham, Lancashire: I'm taking eight trains to get from Lancaster to Kiev - via Paris, Frankfurt, Dresden, Wroclaw, Krakow and Lviv. I bought all the tickets separately and it came to around £400 and it's taking four days. I'm setting off on Tuesday.Jake Norris, 30, originally from Australia: I'm travelling from Hanoi, Vietnam, via two stops in Moscow and Minsk to get to Kiev. It's costing me upwards of £1,500 at this stage. I'm living in Hanoi at present, teaching English. I couldn't miss the opportunity to hopefully see Liverpool win number six! I would have flown from anywhere in the world to see this game.Read more: Liverpool fans' Kiev flights cancelled'I might miss my own honeymoon'
Steven Thompson gets married to fiancée Rachel Harris the day before the finalSteven Thompson, 33, from Chorley, Lancashire: I get married the day before the final. I paid £1,050 for a return flight that gets back at about 5.30am on Sunday (hopefully), then we go on honeymoon at 9am. The ticket cost £140... and potentially one marriage. My fiancée Rachel has known about it for months. She's probably secretly been hoping we'd get knocked out. She says she's not too bothered but I think she'd be quite annoyed if I miss my flight on the Sunday morning. The honeymoon is in Australia, so my contingency plan is to get a later flight and meet her there. There's a flight an hour later, or failing that one in the evening or next morning that would get me to Brisbane a day after her. Hopefully she doesn't go shopping with all the spends while I'm not there.Ryan Stuart, 23, from Wirral: I'm in Greece for my sister's wedding. I'm travelling from Rhodes at 6.40am on Friday 25th to Athens, then I have a six-hour wait in Athens. I'm then flying to Kiev where I arrive at 8pm. I'm staying over that night, watching the game, then I need to be at Kiev airport at 8am to fly back to Athens. I've got to wait another six hours in the airport, then I have to fly to Rhodes and I get back there for 10pm. I'll then travel the hour and a bit back to Lindos and the wedding is on Wednesday 30th. My sister is not happy. We had been joking and singing about going to Kiev for months, not knowing it would actually happen. I wanted to take the groom and he was all in... she was not. Hopefully the flights aren't delayed and I get to see the actual wedding! 'Only three out of five of us got tickets in the ballot'
Jake Chesworth and his dad are part of a group of five family members travelling to Kiev - but only three of them have ticketsWith the demand greatly outweighing the 16,000 tickets Liverpool were allocated for the final, thousands of Reds fans were left disappointed. But, ticket or not, many are still making the trip to Kiev.Mark Dalton, 51, from Chester: I'm leaving Widnes by coach at 9am on Thursday 24th. It's a 1,750-mile journey and includes a stop-off in Poznan for two and a half hours to change drivers. I don't have a ticket yet as I gave mine to my 15-year-old son Matthew. I'm still praying I'll get one!Jake Chesworth, 23, from Aberdyfi, Wales: Me, my two younger brothers, my dad and my uncle are all making the trip over to Kiev. It all began after we beat Manchester City. We'd been to Basel a couple of years prior and found out how difficult it was to get cheap flights and accommodation to the final. So I took a chance and booked flights, trains and accommodation for all of us. No free cancellation. We leave on the Wednesday, fly from London Stansted to Warsaw, have a six-hour wait in Warsaw until we catch the overnight sleeper train to Kiev. We're then spending four nights in a hostel in Kiev. We leave Kiev on the Monday night on the overnight train to Warsaw and fly to London on the Tuesday. We each paid £120 for the flight, £100 for the train, and £50 for the hostel, so not bad. The only issue is that only three out of five of us got tickets in the ballot, so I've been practising my coin toss and rock-paper-scissors skills ever since! 
Luke (far left), Michael (left), Sam (right) and Anthony (far right) are travelling with Jake Chesworth to Kiev - but two of the group will, as it stands, miss out on the matchIvan Mulla, 46, from Liverpool: It's been a nightmare. I'm flying from Leeds to Rome then from Rome to Kiev. The return is from Kiev to Ankara and then Ankara to Antalya then Antalya to Leeds. I'm meeting my son in Kiev who is flying from Adelaide. We don't have match tickets as of yet but we are still hopeful! This behaviour may seem strange but when you're born a Red it's pretty normal.Louis Lovett, 15, from Crosby, Liverpool: I'm travelling from Manchester to Dusseldorf with my dad, before staying the night in Cologne and then going from Cologne to Kiev. We are staying in Kiev for three days - one without a hotel - and don't have any tickets yet! It cost £1,400 for us both, which isn't the ideal situation but the Reds are in another European Cup final.'We're staying with some Ukrainian lad'
This apartment, where student Victor Kylymar lives, is just one of the options for the travelling RedsWith most hotels booked up and others charging extortionate rates, some fans have resorted to fully immersing themselves in Ukrainian culture as a cheaper alternative...Neil O'Flynn, 44, from Lincoln: I live in Lincoln, but I'm travelling to London Stansted on Thursday to catch the plane to Katowice, then I'm getting bus to Krakow where I will stay on Thursday night. On Friday morning, I'm getting the train to Lviv where I will stay the night, and on Saturday morning, I'm getting the train to Kiev and will stay the night with a Ukrainian lad who's put us up on the night of the final, which we found out about through a Facebook page set up for fans struggling to find hotels. On Sunday morning,  I'm getting an 11-hour train back to Krakow and I'm staying there overnight before flying home on Monday to Stansted and then doing the car journey back to Lincoln. It cost £350 each and there are four of us going.Luis Guillen, 26, from Garden Grove, California: I'm flying from California to Germany then from Germany to Kiev. I spent $1,200 for the flight and $2,600 for a match ticket from Stub Hub. I'm renting a room in a flat located in Kiev for five nights for $200, so it's the most expensive trip ever but hopefully it's worth it!Mum and son on tourOne mum is embarking on a "mum and son adventure" with her 11-year-old. The pair have driven thousands of miles to follow Liverpool, and previously travelled to Basel for the 2016 Europa League final between Liverpool and Sevilla. Tracy Moore, 46, from Dorchester, Dorset: I'm picking my son Freddie up from his school residential trip a little early at 1pm, before driving from Poole, in Dorset, to Bristol Airport for a flight to Rzeszow in Poland. From there, we are taking a bus across the border to Lviv in Ukraine. At 6am on Saturday we take a train to Kiev. The reverse journey on Sunday leads us to Warsaw in Poland and we land back at Bristol on bank holiday Monday. We went to all home games this season, driving thousands of miles from our home in Dorset, and ended up with two final tickets which have been given up by a fabulous fellow Red who couldn't organise travel. I will be forever grateful. It's a proper mum-son adventure.

Derby County were beaten in the play-offs for the third time in six seasonsFollow live text coverage of Aston Villa v Fulham on Saturday from 13:00 BST (kick-off 17:00)"You get tests in life and it's how you bounce back."Manager Gary Rowett did his best to remain stoic after his Derby County side were beaten in their play-off semi-final by Fulham - the Rams' third failure at this stage in six seasons.  And history shows it will not be easy for Derby to end up in the top six again next term, because in the seasons following their 2013-14 and 2015-16 play-off defeats, the team finished eighth and ninth.
So is the post-play-off dip a common problem for teams? In order to find out, we studied 30 years of the English Football League knockout format, which began in the 1986-87 season. We also spoke to manager Danny Wilson, who has experienced the highs and lows of play-offs, and a sports psychologist to understand why some teams find it difficult to pick themselves up.The findings
Up to and including the 2016-17 season, the hankies have come out for 252 teams who have had their dreams shattered at the play-off stage.And it seems the post-play-off dip is an issue:Of the 252 teams, 142 (56.3%) did worse the following season, with 14 relegated.51 reached the play-offs again (20.2%).Another 15 were promoted via the play-offs.44 teams achieved automatic promotion.In total, 23.4% bounced back to win promotion the following season.Simon Gleave, head of analysis at Gracenote Sports, has looked specifically at the record of losing play-off finalists:16 of the 93 beaten finalists (17%) have gone up automatically the following season. Reading (in 2002 and 2012) are the only team to achieve the feat twice.Just under a third (29%) have reached the play-offs again the following season. Exeter City, who play Coventry in Monday's League Two final, were the only one of last season's three beaten finalists to reach the play-offs this season.27 (28%) have finished bottom half of the table but avoided relegation, while eight clubs (9%) have suffered the ignominy of going from the brink of promotion to relegation. Leyton Orient (2015) were the last team to go from Wembley one May to desolation the next.So almost 60% of those who failed to achieve promotion via the play-offs have found it difficult to replicate that feat in the subsequent campaign. Why is that?'You can overanalyse failure'When the play-offs don't pay offMost final defeatsSheffield United & Reading (4)Most unsuccessful participationsPreston North End (9)Most participations without making the finalNottingham Forest & MK Dons (4)Most participations without winning finalBrentford & Sheffield United (8)Michael Caulfield, a sports psychologist who has worked with league clubs, suggested players might find it hard to recharge after what they considered a season of "failure".He told BBC Sport: "The sheer sense of disappointment and then thinking all you need to do as a team is turn up and try again is an issue."For a new challenge you will need renewed energy from those who haven't been affected by the past disappointment - it's a very delicate social balance clubs play with here."It is important for players to primarily recognise and recall why they have had such a good season, because they might not see that they have done so well as they will regard it as a failure."I would suggest a complete and utter break from that thinking about what went wrong - professionals often get so emotionally attached to football they can end up overanalysing it."'Make sure players are in the right frame of mind'
Danny Wilson has twice suffered play-off final heartache as a manager - his Swindon Town side fell to a 1-0 defeat by Millwall in the 2010 League One final before his Sheffield United team were beaten by Huddersfield Town on penalties in 2012.He told BBC Sport there were many factors - including having the right state of mind - which dictated how a team would react. "I think, more than anything, confidence is key," he said."It also depends on the strength of the squad. You might have to look at player recruitment in the summer - that will have some bearing as to where you are going to finish the season after."It is also a big test in pre-season to make sure everyone comes back in the right frame of mind, or certainly starts in the right frame of mind after that first week or so."It is about trying to pick the players up."Follow Match of the Day on Instagram for the best photos from the world of football.Additional reporting by BBC Sport's Saj Chowdhury

On latest form for both sides, Saturday's Premiership final between Exeter Chiefs and Saracens should be a more-than mouth-watering encounter.
Defending champions Exeter are in a third final in as many years, while Saracens will be desperate to reclaim the title they won against Chiefs in 2016.
Having watched Saracens' semi-final victory against Wasps on Saturday, at times they appeared to take their opponents apart at will.
Mark McCall's side really lowered their error count, upped their execution and ran really hard into areas where they could exploit a weakness.
The first 20 to 25 minutes was pretty much error-free. They looked like the side who were pretty much unbeatable when they won the domestic and European double in 2016.
Ominously, they have played themselves into the most magnificent form that creates an expectation they will repeat that semi-final performance against Wasps.
For Exeter, they know how to beat Saracens and know what it's like to win these finals having come through against Wasps in extra-time last year.
They also did it very well last season against Saracens in the semi-final. They've won the Premiership final and they know what's required to do so.
It all reads, looks and sounds like a massive game that - with the likes of Owen Farrell, Maro Itoje, Sam Simmonds and Don Armand on show - should be very special.

Focus on England and not me - Don Armand
Sarries defence to break down Chiefs' relentless possession game
Exeter thrive on possession. They feel they have an advantage in possession, that they wear teams down and really take hold of a game in a second half.
But Saracens will be prepared to give away that territory and possession. Exeter won't find that dominance coming so readily and easily, because Saracens are a fit team.
They have quality from one to 23. On the evidence of the past few games, their best players are pretty much back to their best at the business end of the season.
Maro Itoje has returned to his ball-carrying best after a disappointing Six Nations, Mako Vunipola has been omnipresent in everything that's been good about Saracens this season and hopefully Billy Vunipola will come through any injury concerns to take his place.Saracens are almost at their best defending, waiting to pounce on the smallest of mistakes. But, equally, they're now more potent with the ball from anywhere on the field.
They've gone from being a side that was very defensive three or four seasons ago to a side that has opened up their offence.
Statistically, they're probably the most potent in the Premiership with the most clean breaks. A high percentage of those result in either tries or penalties.
Saracens are a clinical side. Exeter are a progressive side.
Exeter are working on their execution, sometimes it doesn't go quite right. But (director of rugby) Rob Baxter backs them to get it right.
Against a Saracens side who are so clinical, who could puncture your defence three or four times and score four tries in quick succession - with Farrell potentially kicking 20-odd points - that could be a tough train to stop.
Exeter will know their game has to be at their very best, while Saracens don't always have to be at their very best.
They know they are very difficult to beat with a strategy that sees them take their time when they enter an opponent's 22. They like to build and then they suck it in and pick-and-go, pick-and-go.
'Box Office' back rows come face-to-face
Billy Vunipola against Sam Simmonds, in the meeting of the two number eights, should really show us why Billy is the number one choice in an England shirt for that position.
Simmonds is a brilliant club player. As brief as he's been a regular for Chiefs, he's had a great impact. He's like an open-side flanker playing at number eight.
He's not stepped immediately into that international position. There's more power required there.
If you don't have that power at six and seven, which he has at Exeter, it allows him as a smaller, quicker man to be able to play at eight.
Sam Simmonds against Billy Vunipola in Premiership final head-to-head
With Don Armand and Dave Ewers alongside in the Chiefs' back row, they can do the donkey-work, some big carrying, allowing Simmonds to play on the edge.
Not that he can't work in congestion, he's better in space. In tight situations, he can use his quick feet.
It's one of those weird anomalies where he's so good at club level but, at the moment, average internationally.
But he's new and I critique him harshly because of what he's up against internationally.
When you look at the likes of Billy Vunipola, they step into the England team and it seems like another game, in another shirt, where they have the same presence and now with added experience - they're world class.
Simmonds has the same impact in a club game, so he's going to be an influential figure on the final for sure.
Can we learn anything from the last two play-off encounters?
Their previous meetings in the past two seasons' play-off games (victory for Saracens in the 2016 final, a win for Exeter in the 2017 semi-final) just gives this final more experience.
For me, the experience of the big time is with Saracens.
Exeter have arrived at the big time and, with victory on Saturday, they rubber-stamped that entry into the big time.
Saracens are already in the big time and, for four or five seasons, they've always been challenging for silverware. Exeter have done it on a domestic level for the past three seasons.
Exeter beat Saracens in the 2017 Premiership semi-final
A last-ditch Sam Simmonds try gave Exeter victory against Saracens in last season's Premiership semi-final
With the big match temperament and experience on Saracens' side, they will be favourites in many people's eyes.
It will be an explosive game because some of these guys are going on tour together the following week.
Exeter flanker Don Armand isn't going to South Africa and will be hoping to show Eddie Jones he's made a mistake. Simmonds will want to show that he can live against these big back rows.
Henry Slade and Jack Nowell for Exeter are match-winners in short spaces of time. Winger Olly Woodburn has had a tremendous season yet again with a number of tries.
The Chiefs' back line has to make it their day because the consistency of the likes of Farrell, Brad Barritt, Alex Lozowski, Chris Wyles, Sean Maitland and Alex Goode for Saracens is irresistible.
They're like the domestic equivalent of New Zealand on their day. As good as Exeter can play, right now their best is not as good as Saracens'.
That doesn't mean Exeter can't win. It's a question of taking the opportunities when they present themselves and when you've made them.
Prediction: Saracens to win by 7-10 points
Saracens scrum-half Ben Spencer celebrates his semi-final try against Wasps
Ben Spencer ran in the last of Saracens' six semi-final tries against Wasps
I see Saracens winning a very hard-fought game.
I think it will be explosive and exciting, particularly if the weather stays as it has been for the past week.
A dry, sunny day makes it potentially more exciting, makes you feel you can play your best rugby, in the best stadium, with huge support. It lifts you to improve on what you've done throughout the rest of the season.
It will be a wonderful, spectacular game, a wonderful advert for Premiership rugby and a great endorsement for the competition.
Saracens are at their potent best and I think, overall, they will keep coming. Exeter will also do the same, but I think that big match experience for Saracens will bring them out as winners.

Australia prop James Slipper banned for cocaine use

 James slipper
Slipper made his international debut against England in 2010
Australia prop James Slipper has been banned for two months after twice testing positive for cocaine.
The Queensland Reds front row, 28, said he had been suffering depression and "recognises now that I was not coping".
Slipper, capped 86 times for the Wallabies, was fined £15,000 and given the minimum mandatory suspension in Rugby Australia's illicit drugs policy.
"We are extremely disappointed to be in this position today," said RA chief executive Raelene Castle.
"James has expressed his sincere remorse. We are fully aware that he is dealing with very significant personal issues and we have been working with him since February on these matters."
Slipper, who made his international debut in 2010, has played more than 100 Super Rugby games for the Reds.
He was omitted from the team that lost to the Wellington Hurricanes last week, with the team citing "welfare reasons" for his absence.
"I have been suffering wellness issues, including depression, for a year and have been receiving professional assistance for the last few months," said Slipper, who returned two positive tests for cocaine taken from urine samples between February and May 2018.
"In no way do my personal circumstances excuse my actions but I recognise now that I was not coping and that I need to properly address these wellness issues."
Slipper's Wallabies and Reds team-mate Karmichael Hunt was suspended for four games earlier this year after he pleaded guilty to possessing a tablet of Xanax.

Chris Ashton: I can still play for England, says Toulon wing
By Chris Jones
BBC Radio 5 live rugby union reporter
From the sectionRugby Union  117
Share this page
 Chris Ashton
Ashton will line up against England for the Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday
Toulon winger Chris Ashton says he has not given up yet on his England career, and has vowed to make an impression for the Barbarians at Twickenham on Sunday.
The 31-year-old, who broke the Top 14 try-scoring record this season, has not played for his country under current coach Eddie Jones.
The former Saracens player won his last England cap in 2014, and is unavailable for selection while playing in France.
"In my head England has never gone away," Ashton told Rugby Union Weekly.
"I'm always looking to prove people wrong. I would like to think I still could do it."
Pod on Tour: With Chris Ashton and the Barbarians
Ashton scored 19 tries in 39 Tests between 2010 and 2014 for England, but was dropped before the 2015 World Cup.
Jones recalled the back to the England set-up at the start of 2016, before a 10-week suspension ruled him out of the Six Nations.
He then missed out on England's tour of Australia in the summer of 2016, an omission which still lingers, and was banned for 13 weeks in September 2016 for biting.
"The bans changed the course of my career," Ashton said.
"At times I thought I was very close to getting back in, and I would like to think if I had I would have changed Eddie Jones' opinion of me. But that opportunity just didn't come, for whatever reason.
"I am in the situation I am now, but I felt I gave it my best even before I went [to France]. The one that sticks with me is the summer tour to Australia.
"I had just got man of the match in the Premiership semi-final and we had just won the European Cup.
"Eddie calls and I have a missed call on my phone. I thought 'I'll ring him back in a minute and he'll tell me I'm going.' I rang him back and he said 'you're not going'.
"Obviously Eddie is at the highest level, he's the coach, and if he's not on your side anything else is irrelevant.
"I was just desperate to get in there and change his mind, which I'm still convinced I could do. I'd be kidding myself if I didn't think I could still [play for England]."
Barbarians game a 'great opportunity'
Ashton is part of a star-laden Barbarians squad for Sunday's match with England at Twickenham, and the former Wigan rugby league player hopes to make the most of his return to the home of English rugby.
"I'm looking for ways to keep the lads sober this week!" he added.
"It's such a good opportunity for me, it's the closest I'm going to get to playing for England right now.
"So I'll take it with both hands."

New Zealand Rugby: 17 Women's World Cup winners given contract for first time
3 hours ago From the sectionRugby Union

 Fiao'o Faamausili
Fiao'o Faamausili helped New Zealand win the Women's Rugby World Cup for the fifth time last year
New Zealand Rugby have given 17 of their Women's World Cup-winning players contracts for the first time.
In total, 28 Black Ferns have been offered the part-time deals, which involve 10-14 hours of training per week and access to technical and medical services.
New Zealand beat England 41-32 in the 2017 World Cup final, despite the Red Roses being on full-time contracts.
England Rugby have since replaced those deals with a match-fee agreement.
Among the New Zealand players awarded contracts are veteran hooker and captain Fiao'o Faamausili, 37, who has put her retirement from international rugby on hold.
Black Ferns head coach Glenn Moore said: "We are thrilled to offer Fi a contract. There are a number of new faces among those named and to have Fi's skills and experience to call on will be invaluable."
The Black Ferns will play two Test matches against Australia for the Laurie O'Reilly Memorial Trophy in August, before a match against the USA Eagles in November.
Black Ferns contracted squad
Backs: Chelsea Alley, Ariana Bayler, Grace Brooker, Kendra Cocksedge, Krysten Cottrell, Ruahei Demant, Kilistina Moata'ane, Victoria Subritzky-Nafatali, Kristina Sue, Renee Wickliffe, Selica Winiata.
Forwards: Eloise Blackwell, Les Elder (nee Ketu), Fiao'o Faamausili, Harono Iringa, Aldora Itunu, Linda Itunu, Pip Love, Charmaine McMenamin, Toka Natua, Joanah Ngan Woo, Te Kura Ngata-Aerengamate, Aleisha Nelson, Marcelle Parkes, Leilani Perese, Dhys Faleafaga, Aroha Savage, Charmaine Smith.

Graphic for What's on (ALWAYS USE THIS)
What's on BBC Sport this week. Uncapped pair Tadhg Beirne and Ross Byrne have been named in a 32-man Ireland squad for the three-Test series against Australia next month.
Beirne, 26, who can play in the back row or second row, becomes eligible for Ireland after agreeing to join Munster from Pro14 finalists Scarlets.
Leinster fly-half Byrne provides cover for Johnny Sexton and Joey Carbery.
The squad announced by coach Joe Schmidt also includes Ulster scrum-half John Cooney, who has won just one cap.
Cooney, who has enjoyed a successful first season with Ulster, came on as a replacement in Ireland's 35-13 win over Japan last summer.
The 28-year-old offers Schmidt a goal-kicking option and can also occupy the number 10 shirt if required.
Conor Murray and Kieran Marmion are the other scrum-halves in the panel.
All of Ireland's frontline players are selected, including Sexton and Rob Kearney, who have not been part of an Ireland summer touring squad since 2014.

Skipper Rory Best is fit to captain the squad after missing Ulster's Pro14 Champions Cup play-off win over the Ospreys with a hamstring injury sustained in training.
The hooker's provincial team-mate Iain Henderson is also included, although he is likely to be an injury doubt for the first Test in Brisbane on 9 June.
Henderson, who has been undergoing rehabilitation in Dublin over the past few weeks, has not played since coming off with a knee injury during a Pro14 game against Munster at the end of April.
Ulster scrum-half John Cooney
John Cooney was named as Ulster's player of the year for the 2017-18 season
Robbie Henshaw and Bundee Aki have overcome knee and ankle injuries respectively in time to travel with the squad.
Notable absentees for the trip down under include injured forwards Sean O'Brien, Josh van der Flier and Tommy O'Donnell, plus backs Chris Farrell and Fergus McFadden.
"This has probably been the most difficult selection process for the coaching group to date.," said Schmidt.
"The coaching group are excited by the challenge that this three-Test tour will present and from talking to the players we get a sense that they too are excited about going on Tour and testing themselves against one of the best sides in the world in their own backyard."
Six Nations Grand Slam champions Ireland are aiming to extend a run of 12 consecutive wins as they continue to build towards the World Cup in Japan in September 2019.
Ireland have not won a series in the southern hemisphere since defeating Australia 2-0 in 1979, but came close in South Africa in 2016 when they were edged out 2-1 by the Springboks after winning the first Test.
The teams will meet in Melbourne for the second Test on 16 June, with the final game in Sydney on 23 June.
Ireland squad: Backs: Bundee Aki (Connacht), Ross Byrne (Leinster), Joey Carbery (Leinster), Andrew Conway (Munster), John Cooney (Ulster), Keith Earls (Munster), Robbie Henshaw (Leinster), Rob Kearney (Leinster), Jordan Larmour (Leinster), Kieran Marmion (Connacht), Conor Murray (Munster), Garry Ringrose (Leinster), Johnny Sexton (Leinster), Jacob Stockdale (Ulster).
Forwards: Tadhg Beirne (Scarlets, joining Munster), Rory Best (Ulster), Jack Conan (Leinster), Sean Cronin (Leinster), Tadhg Furlong (Leinster), Cian Healy (Leinster), Iain Henderson (Ulster), Rob Herring (Ulster), Dan Leavy (Leinster), Jordi Murphy (Leinster, joining Ulster), Peter O'Mahony (Munster), Andrew Porter (Leinster), Quinn Roux (Connacht) James Ryan (Leinster), John Ryan (Munster), CJ Stander (Munster), Devin Toner (Leinster).Wales v South Africa

George North and Ross Moriarty are free to go on Wales' summer tour, says backs coach Rob Howley.
Fellow England-based players Luke Charteris, Tomas Francis and Josh Adams were withdrawn from the trip after the English clubs enforced World Rugby rules over Test match windows.
Wales face South Africa and then Argentina twice in June.
Howley confirmed: "North and Moriarty are available for selection for all three games and will be playing."
The Test between Wales and the Springboks takes place on 2 June, outside the global dates in World Rugby's calendar.
Clubs based outside Wales are under no obligation to release players for games that fall outside those dates.
The Welsh Rugby Union has an agreement with Wales' four regions to ensure their players are available to the national team.
North is joining Ospreys from Northampton for 2018-19 while Moriarty is Dragons-bound from Gloucester.
Saints have been involved in talks aimed at releasing North early from his contract to make the tour.
Moriarty's new boss at Dragons, Bernard Jackman, did not expect any issues over the player's availability.
However, Charteris, Francis and Adams were replaced by Aaron Wainwright, Rhodri Jones and Ashton Hewitt respectively for the trip. Uncapped pair Tadhg Beirne and Ross Byrne have been named in a 32-man Ireland squad for the three-Test series against Australia next month.

However, Charteris, Francis and Adams were replaced by Aaron Wainwright, Rhodri Jones and Ashton Hewitt respectively for the trip. Britain's Cameron Norrie claimed the biggest win of his career with victory over world number 10 John Isner in the quarter-finals of the Lyon Open.
Norrie, 22, ranked 102 in the world, overcame the second seed 7-6 (7-1) 6-4 to reach his first ATP Tour semi-final.
He will play Kazakhstan's Mikhail Kukushkin or Frenchman Gilles Simon in the clay-court event's last four.
Norrie had never played a professional match on red clay until he featured in the Davis Cup in February.
His display in that match against Spain saw him secure a victory over Roberto Bautista Agut and prompted former Great Britain captain John Lloyd to call it "one of the most impressive debuts of all time".
Since then he has improved his world ranking and he will now move into the world's top-100 at an expected 85.
Norrie is yet to drop a set at the event, where top-seed Dominic Thiem is the only seed left in the draw.

Venue: Roland Garros, Paris Dates: 27 May-10 June
Coverage: Daily live radio and text commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live and the BBC Sport website
When Nancy Richey won the 1968 French Open, she never got the prize money, could not ring her parents for the entire tournament and had to change hotels three times in Paris.
The American's victory over Briton Ann Jones in the final should have earned her 5,000 francs (£422 - the equivalent of about £7,000 today) - the first time prize money was offered at a Grand Slam event - but because she, like most of her compatriots, was still an amateur, she could not accept it.
Instead, she received her $27 (£11 at the time) daily allowance - several weeks later.
"It was really unbelievable," Richey told BBC Sport. "It disgusts me... [Americans] didn't get to play for the prize money in the first year."
She is the only amateur winner of a Grand Slam women's singles title since the start of the Open era - and is likely to remain so.
But the 75-year-old is not bitter and here describes how being an amateur had its advantages and how the strikes that paralysed France in May 1968 may have helped her win the title.
And she also explains why she forgave her mum for answering one piece of fan mail.
Amateur v professional era
Nancy Richey
Nancy Richey beat Britain's Ann Jones 5-7 6-4 6-1 in the 1968 French Open final
Having been unable to claim the money in Paris, a few weeks later Richey reached the final at Queen's, which was then a men's and women's tournament. Both singles finals were cancelled through rain and she was given a £250 shopping voucher.
"I would have put it in the bank, if I'd got actual money, but this was a voucher I had to get something with - I wasn't sure what I was going to do with it so I went to [London department store] Liberty's and picked out a set of china and had it shipped home," she said.
"They didn't call it prize money - I couldn't receive it. I guess we'd call it semi-prize money."
She says she has used the fruit-patterned dining set twice.
Richey did eventually turn pro and was a member of the pioneering 'Original 9' - players who broke away from the tennis establishment in 1970 and formed their own professional tennis circuit, which eventually led to the formation of the WTA Tour.
But before that she lived off the $27-a-day allowance she was given by her governing body, the USLTA.
"You could pay your hotel - not a great place - and your food. You scrimped and you got by," she said.
"You didn't make anything but it did pay for it. I was fortunate that my mum and dad didn't push me out - until I got married in 1970, I lived at home. It's a lot different to what happens today."
Richey believes one of the main reasons she won the French Open was because she was in much better shape physically than some of her rivals who had just turned professional, including compatriot and 12-time Grand Slam singles champion Billie Jean King.
"They were travelling, playing one-night things, I don't know if they even played full matches," she said. "They weren't able to really train or play like I was playing, and were not in as good a shape as I was in.
"I beat Billie Jean in the semis - the conditioning had a lot to do with it."
Pioneers of women's tennis

Like all Grand Slam events these days, the French Open offers equal prize money for men and women, with singles champions this year set to take home 2.2m euros (£1.92m).
But it may never have happened without Richey and the rest of the 'Original 9', who risked suspension or expulsion by the tennis authorities when they set up their circuit, partly in protest at the disparity between men's and women's prize money.
They all signed $1 contracts and within the next year more than 40 players were playing for over $300,000 in prize money. In 1973, their Virginia Slims Circuit became the Women's Tennis Association, which still runs women's tennis today.
"The 'Original 9' really started pro tennis for the women. I'm more than thrilled that we were the ones who got it to start. It was a special time," Richey said.
But does she wish she could have been a player on today's Tour, reaping the full benefit of the huge prizes on offer?
"No," she said. "At my stature - five foot three - I don't think there's any way I could compete with the six-footers who are playing today.
"I'm more than thrilled that we were the ones who got it to start. I'm happy - what we did was to get women's tennis where they were playing for lots of prize money."
And as the graphic below shows, if Richey had been allowed to accept her prize in 1968 she would have been able to buy 10% of an average-priced house in Britain, while this year's winner could buy more than eight of them.

'It was like the dark ages' - Paris in May 1968
France was in the grip of civil unrest while the French Open was being played in 1968, and some players could not even get to Paris which led to many first-round walkovers.
Some of those who did make it to the French capital had been forced to be creative in their travel plans, including Richey's brother Cliff, who flew to Luxembourg and paid $100 for a 180-mile taxi ride to Paris with a couple of other players.
And once they were there, the impact of the demonstrations and general strikes was significant.
"As the weeks progressed the tournament kept asking us to move closer to the courts because the gasoline was running out in the official cars," said Richey. "I moved hotel three times.
"It was getting worse by the day after we got in there. The phones weren't working to call out of the country, garbage was piled sky high everywhere. And then right after I won, the strike broke and I could call home and tell my dad and mum that I had won the tournament. Amazing.
"It was like the dark ages. Not to be able to talk to my father, who was my coach for all my playing days, it was off the wall. It was the oddest tournament I ever played in."
Nevertheless, she would not change anything. In fact, she would go as far as to say the strikes had helped her because her brother could not get out of Paris and ended up staying on to coach her through the rest of the tournament.
"I'm really thankful for the strikes because I'm not sure Cliff would have stayed and he was as good in coaching as my dad was, so it was really a key thing to me winning the tournament," she said. "I have to hand him half the trophy at least because he really helped."

Fan mail and groupies, 1960s-style
Tennis players today have millions of followers on social media, who can pore over every 'like', emoji and selfie of their idols.
But in Richey's day, if you wanted to try to engage with your favourite player it had to be pen and paper.
She never replied to any of her fan mail but then her mum responded to a British girl called Mary in 1966.
"When I got home from Australia my mum was standing at the door," Richey recalled. "She says you're going to kill me - and Mary had written back so now it was my responsibility to write to Mary.
"Well, she's now my best friend."
Mary and one of her friends travelled to Paris to follow Richey's journey to the French Open title - no mean feat amid the transport strikes.
"Those were my groupies," she laughed. "They had a hotel eight miles from Roland Garros - they walked to the courts and back for two or three days during the tournament to watch me play. To walk eight miles to the court and back - 16 miles, I can't even conceive of it."
Tennis today 'a little bit boring'
Jelena Ostapenko and Simona Halep
Jelena Ostapenko (right) won the 2017 title but can runner-up Simona Halep (left) go one better this year?
Richey has not played tennis for around 18 years after breaking her foot. These days she keeps fit with daily three-to-four-mile walks around a local park.
Perhaps a hangover from her playing days, she keeps a meticulous record of the number of miles she has clocked: "I've done 310 miles since 1 January."
She still watches a bit of tennis - but does not always enjoy it.
"The game today is 'boom, boom, boom - and boom' - there's no diversity in style, there's no serve and volley. A lot of times it gets a little boring to watch," she said.
But she will be tuning in to see whose name will appear on the Coupe Suzanne Lenglen 50 years after her own.
"I really would like to see [Simona] Halep win, simply because she has come so close so many times. She's kind of faded away in the key areas there so maybe she can get it together," she said. "And [Petra] Kvitova looks like she's having a good year."Britain's Cameron Norrie reached the quarter-finals of the Lyon Open with a second straight-set win in a row.
The 22-year-old, ranked 102 in the world, beat Germany's Maximilian Marterer, the world number 69, 6-1 6-4.
The British number three will next face big-serving American John Isner, the second seed, who beat Romania's Radu Albot 7-6 (7-3) 6-3.
Norrie controlled the opening set and earned the break in the second, sealing the win with his first match point.
Meanwhile, at the ATP Challenger event in Loughborough, James Ward made it into the last eight with victory over American third seed Christian Harrison 7-6 (7-2) 6-3.
Ward, who was given a wildcard for the event, had knee surgery last year and has seen his ranking drop from a career-high of 89 to 614.
But he played some solid tennis against the world number 215 to claim victory.
In French Open qualifying on Wednesday, 19-year-old Briton Jay Clarke lost 6-3 6-1 to Australia's Bernard Tomic.Heather Watson's run at the Nuremberg Cup came to an end with a straight-sets defeat in round two to a qualifier ranked 117 places below her.
The Briton lost 6-3 6-3 to world number 203 Fanny Stollar from Hungary.
Watson lost her opening service game but although she broke back, she was broken again as Stoller, 19, made it 5-3 and then took the opening set.
Watson then dropped her serve twice in the second set to trail 4-1 and was unable to break back.
Meanwhile, British number five and world number 180 Gabi Taylor made it through the first round of French Open qualifying after beating China's Jing-Jing Liu 7-5 6-0.
It is her first attempt to qualify for an overseas Grand Slam and she will next face seventh-seed Mariana Duque-Marino from Colombia, who was pushed all the way by Britain's Katie Boulter before going though 7-6 (7-5) 7-5.
Eugenie Bouchard, the 2014 French Open semi-finalist who has dropped down to 167th in the world, retired injured from her match against Slovenia's Dalila Jakupovic with the Canadian trailing 0-6 1-2.
But 2010 champion Francesca Schiavone is still in with a chance of making the main draw after the 37-year-old Italian, now ranked 265, defeated Bouchard's compatriot Carol Zhao 6-4 3-6 6-3.Heather Watson ended her four-month WTA Tour singles losing streak with victory over Kateryna Bondarenko to reach the second round of the Nuremberg Cup.
The 26-year-old overturned a deficit in the third-set tie-break to beat her Ukrainian opponent 6-3 3-6 7-6 (7-3) and end a winless run of eight matches.
Briton Watson's last victory came in the quarter-finals of the Hobart International in January.
She will play Hungarian qualifier Fanny Stollar in the second round in Germany.
After winning the first set, British number two Watson dropped the second before struggling to hold serve in the decider.
She failed to convert several match points before wrapping up an important win in two hours and 38 minutes.Britain's Dan Evans reached the second round of the ATP Challenger event in Loughborough as he continues his comeback from a 12-month drugs ban.
The 27-year-old beat second seed Max Purcell 6-4 6-2 in the first round.
Evans is playing his second tournament since being suspended after testing positive for cocaine in April 2017.
Elsewhere, British number four Liam Broady lost in the first round of French Open qualifying, going down 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-4) to Czech Zdenek Kolar.
Evans lost in the first round of the Glasgow Trophy last month and has already won three qualifying matches in Loughborough to reach the main draw.
Evans is currently ranked 1,194th in the world, having reached a career high of 41 in 2017."Now I can hopefully say I am an ambassador for young people in foster care or care, that's it not a one-way path to prison or whatever else. There are so many different options you can take."
Five weeks after winning Northern Ireland's first Commonwealth Games athletics medal since 1990, 200m runner Leon Reid is talking about his sometimes hazy childhood memories.
Those 14 different foster homes were dotted all over the English midlands and West Country.
"Birmingham, Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Gloucester, Bristol... all over especially when I was younger," recalls the 23-year-old.
"Different families. Different brothers, different sisters, different schools. They would move you around a lot. I'd be in a different school every other year. Trying to make friends. It was sport really that kind of grounded me."
Reid puffs out his cheeks at one point and you wonder whether you've pressed him a little too much.
But he keeps going, explaining how he empathises with the upheaval his arrival maybe visited on some of his foster families.
"You are young and you don't think about the fact that they are taking you into their family, into their lives."
Reid placed into care as a baby
Reid's Belfast-born mother Anne-Marie had moved to Bath with her parents and it was his grandparents who maintained the young Leon's connection with his birth family after he was placed into care as a baby.
"My mother had her own difficulties. We tried to stay in touch (the two of us)," recalls Leon of his birth mother who passed away in 2016.
But it was a case of "in and out" of foster home after foster home for the first decade of Leon's life although a schoolyard scrap at the age of six started an unlikely chain of events which led to him finding a stable family environment.
Within five years, he was the adopted brother of the young boy he had fought with.
"That day, we were best friends by lunchtime.
"From then, it was a case of staying around Ryan's house every other night. His mum (Claire Russell), my mum now, got us put in the same football team together. We were just inseparable.
"My mum went through all the legal battles and by the time by I was 11, she was my mum and I had a brother Ryan and a sister Olivia."
With Claire hailing from Enniscorthy in Wexford, the young Leon got quickly used to regular family trips to Ireland.

Leon Reid took won European Junior and Under-23 silver medals for Britain
Sprint talent spotted as a 15-year-old
Amid the two brothers trying just about every sport possible, Leon's athletics talent quickly became obvious as a 15-year-old.
Within eight months he was winning two European Youth Olympics medals for Britain.
But despite clinching the English Schools title a year later in 2012, he missed out on a place at the World Junior Championships later that summer.
Having showed his championship pedigree by winning European Junior 200m silver in 2013, Reid's 2014 campaign was hindered by a broken cheekbone after an accidental collision with a fellow athlete, although he did battle through the pain barrier to compete for Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games.
Fully fit the following summer, Reid believed his early-season times of 20.62 and 20.67 seconds should have had him in the mix for the British 200m spot at the European Team Championship but there was no contact from the selectors as they opted for the experienced Danny Talbot who finished second in the event in 20.62 seconds.
"In the end, they said they didn't select me because I didn't show interest in wanting to do the event.
"I didn't know you needed to show interest to represent your country. I thought that was why we did the sport to be the best that we can be and show that on the big stage."

Reid waiting on key IAAF July decision
While he did win another European Championship 200m silver at Under-23 level later that summer, a sense of disillusionment with the UK set-up was setting in.
By early 2017, after talking over the issue at length with coach James Hillier and his mother, Reid decided to apply to the IAAF to have his international eligibility changed from Britain to Ireland.
However just as Leon was getting all the necessary documents together came the news that the IAAF had put an immediate block on international transfers because of the huge amount of predominantly African athletes switching to other countries.
Fifteen months on, Reid's ambition to represent Ireland remains in limbo with his plea to IAAF president Lord Coe prior to last August's World Championships in London already having fallen on deaf ears.
The Bath-born sprinter is now having to wait on the next meeting of the IAAF's council in Buenos Aires in July which is expected to make a final deliberation on the issue of international transfers.
Michael Johnson urges the IAAF to take action on Leon Reid's eligibility appeal
Legendary Johnson backs Reid switch plea
If Reid gets an immediate green light, he will be in line to represent Ireland at the European Championship in Berlin a few weeks later, with the athlete hoping public backing from Michael Johnson during BBC's Commonwealth Games coverage will do his cause no harm.
Reid is adamant an unfavourable outcome in Argentina will not lead him to reconsider the option of representing Britain again.
"I feel like it should be fine and I should be at the Europeans in August. I'll be ready to run. I'm preparing for it anyway. We're just waiting for Seb Coe to tick a box."
Johnson described Reid's plea to the IAAF as a "legitimate allegiance transfer" after watching the Northern Irishman being awarded 200m bronze in Australia following the disqualification of England's first-placed Zharnel Hughes for a lane infringement.
Reid working three jobs
Reid may now be receiving congratulations from all and sundry for his Commonwealth medal but is still having to work three jobs to fund his sporting career which includes a nightclub stint from 9pm until 3am as well as coaching five to seven-year-olds at a school in Bath.
Leon laughs when he recalls how his pupils were completely underwhelmed by his medal when he brought it into school as they instead wanted to see the teddy bear he had also been presented with on the podium.
"They were saying: 'Where's the teddy. We saw that he was wearing pyjamas'," he laughs.
Fittingly after all she has done for him, Leon presented his mother with the cuddly toy although he jokes that she has now passed it on to his nephew "without my permission".
"I will have to take it back when he's asleep."Britain's Olympic and world 10,000m champion Mo Farah said he felt "tired" after his first victory in the 10km Great Manchester Run.
Farah, who finished third at the London Marathon last month, raced past Ugandan Moses Kipsiro with 100 metres left to win in 28 minutes 27 seconds.
Abel Kirui of Kenya finished third, 25 seconds behind Farah.
Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba won her third straight women's race, well ahead of Kenya's Joyciline Jepkosgei.
In the men's wheelchair race, Britain's David Weir beat Johnboy Smith and Simon Lawson to win in 21 minutes 28 seconds.
In the women's wheelchair race, Britain's Liz McTernan was victorious in 34 minutes 20 seconds ahead of Heather Gilham and Lucy Keyworth.
Watch BBC coverage of the Great Manchester Run
Farah, who was appearing in the race for the first time since 2007, took part in a minute's silence before the race in tribute to the 22 people who died in last year's Manchester Arena bombing.
For most of the race, the 35-year-old looked comfortable in warm conditions as he kicked past Kipsiro with 100 metres to go.
But he said he was still recovering from breaking the British record at last month's marathon - his first event over the distance since switching his focus to road racing.
"I've got great speed and I know that at the end of the races I can use it if the guys haven't hurt me enough, so today was a matter of hanging in there," he told BBC Sport.
"I was pretty tired. Having competed in the marathon not so long ago, today was hard work."Britain's Zharnel Hughes beat 2011 world champion Yohan Blake and American Tyson Gay to win the Boston Games 100m.
Hughes, 22, won in 9.99 seconds with South African Akani Simbine second, Blake third and Gay fourth.
It is the first time he has run sub-10 seconds but the time will not count as he was aided by a 2.4m/sec tailwind.
Last month, Hughes finished first in the Commonwealth Games 200m but was disqualified for impeding gold medallist Jereem Richards.
The sprint races in Boston were taking place on a special 200m straight track.
Britain's Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake finished second in the 150m behind 20-year-old American Noah Lyles.Leon Reid says athletics has helped to keep him grounded after most of his childhood was spent in foster care.
The Bath-born sprinter wants to represent Ireland in honour of his late Belfast-born biological mother but must wait for governing body the IAAF to approve his international transfer.
Reid, who last month won a 200m bronze medal for Northern Ireland at the Commonwealth Games, hopes his achievements can be a source of inspiration for young people with a similar background.
"Now I can hopefully say I was an ambassador for young people in foster care or care that it's not a one-way path to prison or whatever else - there's so many different options you can take," said Reid, who has won European Junior and Under-23 medals for Britain. Competitors in the Great Manchester Run, including Mo Farah, take part in a minute's silence on the start line of the 10km event as part of the commemorations for the first anniversary of the Manchester bomb attack.British former Olympic champion Darren Campbell has left hospital and is recovering at home after suffering a bleed in the brain.
The 44-year-old had to be resuscitated after having a seizure at home.
"Thank you to everyone for your prayers and well wishes. I am humbled by the love shown to me. I'm finally back home with my family," he posted on social media on Saturday.
Campbell won 4x100m relay gold at the 2004 Olympics in Athens.
He told BBC Sport on Tuesday that he had a pituitary apoplexy - a bleed into the gland at the base of the brain.
"I nearly died," said the BBC Radio 5 live pundit and presenter. "You have to give thanks. That is how close it was."The expected Great CityGames duel between Aries Merritt and Andrew Pozzi over 110m hurdles produced an unexpected winner with Poland's Damian Czykier taking an error-strewn race.
American world record-holder Merrit and Britain's world indoor champion Pozzi both clattered hurdles, finishing well off the winner's 13.67 seconds.
Six-time Olympic champion Allyson Felix was beaten by in-form Marie-Josee Ta Lou in the 150m in Manchester.
Ivorian Ta Lou won in 16.60 seconds.
The world silver medallist at both 100m and 200m, Ta Lou's explosive start gave American Felix too much to make up.
Britain's Harry Aikines-Aryeetey edged a tight 100m on the pop-up track along Deansgate, dipping two-hundredths of a second ahead of compatriot Richard Kilty to win in 10.35 seconds.
Sophie Hahn - the Olympic, world and European T38 champion - beat Georgie Hermitage, who runs in the T37 category, in a women's race involving athletes from both classifications.
Leon Reid, who took Commonwealth Games 200m bronze for Northern Ireland last month, secured a hard-won victory in the 150m, holding off the Netherlands' Solomon Bockaire.
American Bershawn Jackson won the 200m hurdles in 22.59 seconds before explaining that the loss of his 53-year-old father from a heart attack in October 2016 is behind his decision to leave the sport at the end of the season.
"Mentally I am not there any more, it is time for a new chapter," the 35-year-old former 400m hurdles world champion told BBC Two.
British athletes were beaten to victory in the two field events held in nearby Albert's Square.
Commonwealth Games bronze medallist Luke Cutts was second to France's Stanley Joseph in the pole vault, while Eloyse Lesueur of France took the long jump ahead of Rio 2016 finalist Jazmin Sawyers.Think you can't run?

That was the equation for the Pankhurst Centre Runners to make the 10,000m of the 2018 Great Manchester Run.
To commemorate the centenary of women getting the vote, the group that looks after the birthplace of the Suffragettes movement sent a call out for women to gather together again in union - this time to run.
The Pankhurst Centre, next to the Manchester Royal Infirmary, is where Emmeline Pankhurst - the leader of the Suffragettes movement - lived with her two daughters.
It is also where the Women's Social and Political Union held its first meeting in 1903.
"100 years ago a parliamentary act profoundly changed the way we defined citizenship in our society," said Flavie Vial, one of the Pankhurst Centre Runners before their run.
In the last few years I've realised the mental benefits of running

"It's incredible that 100 years on we can all come together to celebrate those very brave women who fought so hard for many years to give all of us a platform to be able to express our views and concerns and finally be listened to.
She described their taking part as " just a very small tribute for what was an amazing achievement from trail leaders".
"It's an incredible celebration and it's also important to think just how far we've come but also how much more there is still to do," added Bex Schindler.
"It's really important that we raise awareness about our city's incredible heritage and our radical Manchester roots."There is one event that long-distance runner Salah Ameidan takes part in every year - the gruelling Sahara Marathon in south-west Algeria. It's not only the thrill of the competition that attracts him, though - this is also the closest he can get to his family, who live behind a wall in the desert, in territory governed by Morocco.
We're deep in the desert in south-west Algeria looking out at parched, cracked flatlands. With minutes to go before the horn blows, I join Salah Ameidan on his gentle warm-up as he prepares his mind and his lithe limbs for the tough terrain ahead.
Around us, hundreds of athletes are gathering at the starting line dressed in neon yellow and orange Lycra, using the pointy edges of their neck scarves to rub sand out of their eyes.
The conditions for today's run are likely to be treacherous: burning breeze, wandering camels and shifting sand dunes.
But Ameidan's not concerned about that - his mind is elsewhere.
He's reflecting on previous long-distance runs in his homeland, Western Sahara, when his father was still there to cheer him on.
"My father passed away a year and a half ago but I wasn't allowed to go to his funeral," he says.
He hasn't seen his family since 2004, when, while racing in France, he raised the flag of the Saharawi people - the indigenous population of Western Sahara - and fled into exile in France rather than return to likely imprisonment in Morocco.

Ameidan was 12 years old when he was recruited to run for the national Moroccan athletics team. Within 10 years he had become one of the world's top long-distance runners - the Moroccan national champion and the Arab World Champion on two occasions.
But a race in 2000 altered the course of his life.
"I won, but I was forbidden from having the prize," he says. "At that point, I began to think about how to make my own way and to get myself out of this system."

It was this that led ultimately to his act of protest in France, four years later.
On entering the stadium at the end of a 10km race, Ameidan took the Saharawi flag - illegal in Morocco - from a friend in the crowd, and raised it victoriously while crossing the finish line.
"I realised there had been something missing inside of me. I felt a sense of freedom holding the Saharawi flag - and, for the first time, a sense of responsibility," he tells me.
From this moment on, he hasn't been able to safely visit them, and his family can't go to France for fear that they wouldn't be allowed to return home.
"My mother and my sister are still in the occupied territories but I am banned from visiting them," he says.
Eleven members of his wider family have been arrested and interrogated because of his actions.
"I put myself and my family at serious risk."

The closest Ameidan can get to his family is here on the Algerian border, 500km away from his home city of Laayoune in what Saharawis call the "occupied territories" of Western Sahara, close to the Atlantic coast.
Morocco has claimed those areas since 1975, when its troops moved in from the north, sparking a bitter, bloody war with the indigenous Saharawi people.
It was to be a temporary move but, a generation later, the territories remain divided by a heavily landmined wall snaking 2,700km through the desert. Land to the east of the wall is governed by the Polisario, the Saharawi independence movement. The Berm of Shame, as it's known to local Saharawis, continues to separate thousands of families like Ameidan's.
When the conflict broke out, those who could fled across the desert to neighbouring Algeria, seeking sanctuary. There, in Tindouf province, they set up six refugee camps, now home to tens of thousands of people. The Sahara Marathon is run through those camps - and some of those who live there are taking part in the race, which is another reason it's an unmissable event for Ameidan.
"I'm so happy to be back among my people," he shouts over to me while posing for selfies with enthusiastic fans. "Every year I get just one month's break and I choose to come here. That shows how important it is for me to participate in this race."
Image copyrightSAHARA MARATHON
Most of the rest of the year he lives in France, where he works as a running coach.
But grateful as he is to have been offered sanctuary by the French authorities, he has declined citizenship.
"You only have one homeland," he says.
"I made my decision to be pure Saharawi - it's not good to make a lot of contradictions."
Image copyrightSAHARA MARATHON
Since the fateful 2004 race, running has become more than a sport for Ameidan - it's a platform to highlight the plight of the Saharawi people.
"Running is a weapon that I can use to amplify my people's voices and it's a peaceful one," he says.
"You taste freedom when you run but it's an incomplete and unfinished freedom. As long as my land is occupied, I can't fully enjoy my freedom."
Being banned from Morocco, and separated from his family, is the price he has to pay for his political convictions. "And I will happily pay it," he says.
But, at least in the elation of a successful race - he came second in the 10km event, with a time of 36:03 - he is far from downhearted.
I battle through the hordes of fans at the finish line to speak to him. He mops beads of sweat from his brow, and gestures to the ululating crowd.
"We are so determined to reach our goal of independence," he says, "I consider this stage as a bridge before we go back to our country. Without hope, there is no life..."
Britain's Simon Yates retained his lead at the Giro d'Italia after a wet sprint finish on stage 17 in Iseo.
Italy's Elia Viviani took his fourth stage victory of the 2018 tour from Ireland's Sam Bennett in a chaotic final push as the rain lashed down.
Yates had begun the day with a 56-second lead over reigning champion Tom Dumoulin after Tuesday's time trial.
And the 25-year-old finished the 155km course from Riva da Garda safely in the main pack to maintain his title bid.
Yates is bidding to become the first British man to win the Giro - Nicole Cooke won the women's equivalent in 2004 - with three mountain stages that should suit him better than Dumoulin to come on Thursday, Friday and Saturday before the race finishes in Rome on Sunday.
He finished in 28th place but on the same time as Dumoulin of the Netherlands and four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome.
Team Sky's Froome is in fourth place, behind Italian Domenico Pozzovivo of Bahrain-Merida, who is three minutes and 11 seconds down on Yates.
Simon Yates' Giro d'Italia stage-by-stage guide
There were two casualties before the race began on Wednesday as South Africa's Louis Meintjes pulled out with a respiratory infection and Belgian Victor Campenaerts also withdrew.
And on a turbulent stage from Riva del Garda with constant attacks, Yates managed to keep out of trouble as Viviani recovered from a mechanical problem to prove his class in the final sprint.
The win for Viviani effectively wraps up the points classification - he leads Bennett by 58 points with Sunday's finale into Rome the only likely place where either will pick up more points, with 50 on offer for the winner of the stage.

Simon Yates is on the verge of becoming the first British man to win the Giro d'Italia.
The Mitchelton-Scott rider, who showed his pedigree by finishing seventh at last year's Tour de France to win the best young rider's white jersey, leads defending champion Tom Dumoulin by 56 seconds with four stages remaining.
Fellow Briton Chris Froome started the 101st edition of the the three-week race looking to become just the third rider to win three successive Grand Tours.
However, the Team Sky rider, who won his fourth Tour de France title last July and followed that with victory in the Vuelta a Espana, is now almost five minutes down on Yates.

Simon says: The first of three big days to decide the Giro. I really see two races developing on a stage like today, one for the lucky climbers who make the break and the other between the key General Classification guys on the final and only climb of the day.
Simon's one to watch: Carlos Betancur - the Colombian climber is yet to win a Grand Tour stage but has numerous top-10 finishes on mountain stages and to add to his pedigree, he was the best young rider at the Giro in 2013.
Stage 19: Friday, 25 May - Venaria Reale-Bardonecchia, 184km
Giro d'Italia stage 19
Simon says: This is the hardest day of the race - the Queen stage - and I expect it to be won by a General Classification rider, although you could see big gaps between them. There's a lot of GC players starting the Giro who need to be aggressive and if you have good legs you can really make a difference on a day like today.
The break might go to collect King of the Mountain points but I predict it will most likely come back together on the final ascent.
Simon's one to watch: Chris Froome - will he be needing to attack? This promises to be an exciting day regardless of who is in the lead.
Stage 20: Saturday, 26 May - Susa-Cervinnia, 214km
Giro d'Italia stage 20
Simon says: The final chance. The General Classification battle will determine how this final stage is raced, but I guarantee it will be action-packed and you will see a lot of key guys marking each other. With only the procession in Rome to follow, our winner will be decided today.
This could play into the hands of somebody slightly off the radar on GC for the stage win.
Simon's one to watch: George Bennett - the New Zealander is yet to win a Grand Tour stage but comes into the race in decent form having finished fifth in the Tour of the Alps last month.
Stage 21: Sunday, 27 May - Rome, 115km
Giro d'Italia stage 21
Simon says: Emotions on this day depend on how the previous 20 days have panned out, but there's always a sense of relief. Your body is on the brink of exhaustion and everyone is looking forward to stepping off the bike, having a rest and spending some time with family and loved ones.
What an incredible city to finish off our epic three weeks of racing. A short, sharp circuit race in the city of Rome is our last stage. A day for the surviving sprinters who have endured an arduous third week with one eye on victory.
Simon's one to watch: Elia Viviani - it's hard to back against the Italian who will be keen to impress in his capital city.
British Cycling has announced a nine-strong team to represent Great Britain at next month's UCI BMX World Championships in Azerbaijan.
Reigning junior world champion Beth Shriever will step up to senior level after winning her first world cup in Zolder earlier this month.
Kyle Evans, Quillan Isidore and Tre and Kye Whyte will all race in the elite men's event.
The championships will take place in Baku from 8-9 June.
Ross Cullen and Tian Isidore will line up for Great Britain in the junior men's event while Elissa Bradford and Libby Smith will compete in the junior women's.
Shriever said: "I'm thrilled to be able to represent my country again at the World Championships. I'm pleased with how my season has gone so far but I'm not putting too much pressure on myself given that it's my first year as an elite rider."
World and Commonwealth pursuit champion Charlie Tanfield has been added to the Great Britain cycling team.
The 21-year-old will join the men's endurance programme along with fellow team pursuit world champion Ethan Hayter, 19.
Tanfield, who rose to prominence with amateur trade team Team KGF, followed his world team gold with individual pursuit gold on the Gold Coast.
"It's great to see that all the hard work has paid off," he said.
"I have some very high ambitions which I want to achieve during my cycling career and the GB endurance programme fills me with confidence that I'm in the right place."
Charlie Tanfield takes gold in the men's 4000m individual pursuit
Hayter has been promoted from the senior academy, and performance director Stephen Park says he has enjoyed seeing how he and Tanfield have had different pathways to the podium programme.
"I have the utmost respect for Charlie and his Team KGF team mates who have enjoyed success at World Cup level independently of British Cycling," said Park.
"Their approach has been refreshing to see and it's great for track cycling as a sport that independent riders can be this competitive and push for places on the GB team.
"Ethan has followed the more traditional route along our performance pathway to reach the podium programme and it will no doubt have served as inspiration for the riders on the team pathway to have seen him on the top step of the podium wearing the rainbow jersey."Every four years, Britain's cyclists demonstrate at the Olympics that they are among the very best in the world.
Bradley Wiggins, Laura and Jason Kenny and Chris Hoy are among those who have become household names by their success in the sport.
Next to that sort of star quality, Simon Yates is a relative unknown. But it is he who stands on the brink of history - becoming the first Briton to win the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours.
The 25-year-old goes into the final five days of the Giro as clear favourite after surviving Tuesday's time trial - a relative weak spot for him - with a 56-second lead, and with stages that suit him better still to come.
But who exactly is Simon Yates?
1. He is a twin - younger brother Adam is also a professional cyclist and was part of Britain's men's road race team at the Rio Olympics in 2016.
Adam finished fourth at the 2016 Tour de France and became the first British rider to win the young rider classification.
The Yates brothers grew up in Bury, in Greater Manchester, and say black puddings are one of the town's best exports.

2. Simon says his greatest achievement so far on the bike is his unexpected 2013 points race gold medal at the World Championships in Minsk at the age of 20.
3. He has served a ban for 'non-intentional' doping.
During the 2016 Paris-Nice race, he was taking the banned substance terbutaline to treat his asthma, but his team's doctor had failed to apply for a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) which would have meant he could take it and stay within the rules. The team took responsibility for the administrative error but Simon was still given a four-month ban.
4. Simon and Adam got into cycling after their father John collided with a car while out riding.
During his recovery, he took his boys along with him to the Manchester velodrome, and from there they were hooked.
Both brothers showed obvious talent and soon joined their father's cycling club, where they were spotted by pro teams and British Cycling.
How has he got to this point?
Yates finished seventh overall in the 2017 Tour de France and won the young rider classification, matching the feat achieved by twin brother Adam a year earlier.
In 2018 he won stage seven of the Paris-Nice to take the overall race lead going into the final stage only to be pipped by Movistar's Marc Soler, who beat him by four seconds.

Just how big an achievement will it be if he wins?
BBC Sport chief sports writer Tom Fordyce
No British rider has ever won the Giro. Several have been fancied to, not least Sir Bradley Wiggins, the year after he had become the first Briton to win the Tour de France.
But just as Wiggins was defeated by a combination of injury and a loss of nerve on the race's treacherous descents, so Team Sky's other attempts were also derailed; Geraint Thomas was in fabulous form in 2017 but then collided with a badly parked police motorbike and was forced to abandon with injury a few days later.
Chris Froome had been the Briton most expected to succeed this year, but he crashed before the race even began, on his reconnaissance lap of the time-trial course for the opening stage in Jerusalem.
But while Sky's attempts to control this wild race have repeatedly failed, Yates has ridden into pink in a very different way - with constant attacks, with unpredictable moves. If he gets his reward in Rome on Sunday it will be entirely deserved.
Simon Yates will go into the final five days of the Giro d'Italia as clear favourite after surviving Tuesday's time trial with a 56-second lead.
On a day when Australia's Rohan Dennis took the stage win, Yates finished the 34.2km course in 22nd place.
That was 97 seconds down on Dennis, but more importantly only 75 off reigning champion Tom Dumoulin in third.
Yates, who began Tuesday 2mins 11secs ahead of Dumoulin, said: "I'm very satisfied with where I stand now."
Simon Yates' Giro d'Italia stage-by-stage guide
He added: "I'm really happy. I felt good in the first half. I had a good rhythm. I was trying to hold on to my position, but I died in the final 10km.
"Being in the lead after the time trial changes my tactics for the remaining stages. Unfortunately for the fans, I might be more defensive."
Dumoulin was 21 seconds up on Yates at the first time-check, 12km in, and had extended that to 48 seconds at 24km.
The world time-trial champion had won the Giro a year ago in large part through his dominant form against the clock and would have hoped to take much more out of Yates, who has struggled in time trials in the past.
But Yates had come home seventh in the short opening time trial on the first day of this Giro in Jerusalem and his hard work over the winter on his aero position paid off when he needed it most.
There was a solid ride from Chris Froome, the Briton 35 seconds down on stage winner Dennis to move back up to fourth on the general classification, 3mins 50secs behind Yates.
Italy's Domenico Pozzovivo is in third, with France's Thibaut Pinot the big loser after a disastrous performance saw him cross the line over three minutes behind Dennis' time.
But it was Yates' day, the 25-year-old having only one worrying moment when he took the wrong line through a late corner, losing a few seconds but no more.
No Briton has ever won the Giro and with three mountain stages to come on Thursday, Friday and Saturday before the race finishes in Rome on Sunday, there is still scope for his rivals to attack - and terrain to test his nerve.
But the rider from Bury, near Manchester, has been in peerless form in the mountains across the first two and a half weeks and will know he has history in his sights.Britain's Simon Yates stormed to a sensational solo win on stage 15 to take a tight grip on the overall lead at the Giro d'Italia.
The 25-year-old attacked with 18km to go of the stage to Sappada to blow away his rivals for the pink jersey.
On a day when Chris Froome lost more time, reigning champion Tom Dumoulin also fell back.
No Briton has ever won the Giro but with one week to go Yates now has a lead of two minutes 11 seconds.

Podcast: Simon Yates' knockout blow?
He admitted to feeling emotional after his third road stage win of this Giro.
Yates becomes the first man to win three stages while wearing the pink jersey since 2003 when Gilberto Simoni went on to win. Vincenzo Nibali won three while race leader in 2013 but one was an individual time trial and another awarded to him after stage winner Mauro Santambrogio tested positive for EPO and had his results annulled.
"I didn't know that," Yates told Eurosport. "I do like the stats, I like the numbers. It's really fantastic. I don't know why but I'm a bit emotional after today. I really gave it everything."
It was arguably his most impressive stage win yet, his sparkling form matched by the elan with which he timed his move.
Dumoulin stays second overall after battling through to finish third on the stage, 41 seconds behind Mitchelton-Scott rider Yates and picking up only four bonus seconds for his placing compared to Yates' 10 for the stage win.
Monday is a rest day before Tuesday's time trial when Yates faces a battle to stay in the maglia rosa.
"It's a good gap but (Dumoulin) could take two minutes out of me in a time trial. I've been fighting since Israel to have a good gap. I'm happy with that gap but it could disappear in 35km. We'll have to see."
Froome, who had looked reborn in his win on Monte Zoncolan on Saturday, lost a minute and a half on the day and is now almost five minutes down on his young compatriot, dropping two places in the general classification to seventh.
On a punchy day of second category climbs the racing was relentless, a huge break of 26 riders going up the road early on but gradually being whittled down to just Italy's Guilio Ciccone and German Nico Denz with 30km to go.
Dumoulin's Sunweb team pushed the pace hard in the main pack as the race climbed into the final hour, Yates watchful on his rival's wheel and Froome in the company of Team Sky team-mate Sergio Henao.
With 18km to go, an acceleration from Miguel Angel Lopez on the penultimate climb caused splits in that group and Froome was the man to pay the price, dropping back and left without team-mates.
Yates spotted his fellow Briton's distress and attacked, as any ruthless race leader should, jumping away to an 18-second advantage over a five-man group of Dumoulin, Lopez, Richard Carapaz, Domenico Pozzovivo and Thibaut Pinot, with Froome quickly a minute and 10 seconds adrift.
It was a move of both bravery and risk, but with the chasing group unwilling or unable to work together, Yates kept pushing up the final climb and extending his precious lead.
He looked exhausted at the finish but knows he has given himself a wonderful chance of making history.
Meanwhile, Ireland's Nicholas Roche and BMC team-mate Loic Vliegen both abandoned the race on Sunday. It was the first Grand Tour Roche had failed to finish in 19 races.
Chris Froome held off fellow Briton Simon Yates to win a first ever stage of the Giro d'Italia - a thriller on Monte Zoncolan.
Yates finished six seconds behind Froome and stretched his overall lead over Tom Dumoulin to one minute 24 seconds with the reigning champion holding on impressively to come home fifth.
The infamous Zoncolan is known as the hardest climb in European cycling, and the huge crowds lining its upper slopes were treated to an epic finale.
This was redemption of sorts for Sky's Froome after an injury-hit first two weeks.

Bespoke podcast: Chris Froome can still win title despite deficit, says Brailsford
Froome's stage win means he leaps up to fifth in the overall standings, but he is still three minutes 10 seconds down on race leader Yates.
Dumoulin, the world time-trial champion, is expected to take at least a minute and a half out of Yates on Tuesday's 34.2km time trial, which meant that Mitchelton-Scott rider Yates had targeted Saturday's tough stage as one where he could try to bank significant time as the the pair battle for supremacy.
And for the Dutchman to lose only 38 seconds - 32 on the day and six more for Yates' second place on the stage - represents a fine return for a man who is not a natural climber.
The Zoncolan averages 11.9% over its 10.1km length, with a maximum gradient of 22%. The Tour de France's better-known Alpe d'Huez averages 8%, with a maximum of 12%, while Mont Ventoux is far longer at 21.5km but averaging just over 7%.
Simon Yates
Simon Yates could become the first Briton to win the Giro
Davide Formolo and Fabio Aru were the first of the big boys to feel the pain, dropping back with 6km to the summit.
Froome had team-mate Wout Pouls working with him, and the Team Sky pair led into the final 5km with Yates sitting third, Domenico Pozzovivo just behind and Dumoulin hanging on with Thibaut Pinot, who had begun the day third in the general classification.
On long sections of 15% section, the group thinned and drew away from the rest, and with 4.2km to go Froome attacked for the first time in this Giro.
He quickly built a small gap over Pozzovivo and Miguel Angel Lopez, Yates joining them as Dumoulin tried to maintain a steady pace rather than respond to the acceleration.
At 3km Yates made his own move, dropping the Italian and Colombian with glorious ease and hunting down the troubled Froome as the gap to Dumoulin began to stretch.
With 1500m of climbing to go that advantage for the young Briton over his main rival was up to 24 seconds, and he stretched that a little further by the finish even as he could not quite catch an exhausted Froome in a frenzied last few metres.
Froome said: "It is a really special feeling winning on top of that climb. On such a monumental climb for the race and in general is such a good feeling after a such a tough start to this race for me.
"I felt like 4km was the moment when the race was on the limit and was the moment to go. The team had done a great job pulling me to that point, but right to the line Simon was right on me.
"I didn't know if he was going to catch me, so it was such a relief to get into that final 100m."
No Briton has ever won the Giro, and Yates knows that his own bid still hangs in the balance with the race finishing in Rome on Sunday 27 May.City and town centre streets across the United Kingdom will once again be closed to traffic this summer for British Cycling's 'Let's Ride' events.
More than 100,000 cyclists took part in the 2017 events across 14 different cities, riding approximately 1,595,500 kilometres.
And, after Cardiff kicked off proceedings this year on 13 May, there are 15 more city and town events for you to choose from.
The events are all free and non-competitive, with riders able to cycle around the route as often as they like.
The atmosphere is electric. You've just got to do it - you've got to experience it!

It doesn't matter what kind of bike you want to ride, how fast you go, how experienced a cyclist you are or how old you are.
"Such a simple thing as a short closed-road route can be so much fun," said one Let's Ride 2017 participant.
"I found myself smiling the whole way round."
You don't even have to worry about owning a bike as you will be able to rent a bike at the events.
And it's not only the riding to enjoy.
On the day of the events there will be additional entertainment for families along the route staged by local community groups, museums and other cultural attractions.

"The benefits of increased levels of cycling are obvious: getting more people on bikes will make us healthier, ease congestion on our roads and clean up our toxic air," says British Cycling chief executive Julie Harrington.
Indeed, research carried out by Newcastle University during the 2017 Let's Ride event in the city showed the levels of nitrogen oxide and nitrogen dioxide fell by around 75% from the normal recorded levels on the streets.

Chris Froome can still win the Giro d'Italia despite being three minutes off the pace going into the final week, says Team Sky boss Sir Dave Brailsford.
The British four-time Tour de France winner had a difficult first two weeks but won a first Giro stage on Saturday.
"Can he still do it? Absolutely he can," Brailsford told BBC Radio 5 live.
"Vincenzo Nibali was further back in the general classification in 2016 and won. The key guys rise to the top due to an incredible ability to recover."

Froome, 32, fell heavily in preparation for the three-week event and crashed again during stage eight.
He is three minutes and 10 seconds behind Mitchelton-Scott rider Yates with seven stages remaining - they include three which are mountainous, where Froome will be looking to eat up the time, and a time trial.
Brailsford said critics were too quick to dismiss his lead rider's chances after the early setbacks.
"When the [first] crash happened that put us on the back foot," added the former British Cycling chief.
"Instead of trying to build up during the first week of the Giro, Chris spent it trying to recover from the crash. However, in the last couple of days he's started to feel better. And the talk last night [Friday] and this morning was about taking it on.
"Did I see it coming? It wasn't impossible. Was it probable? We weren't sure.
"In this day and age, people are quick to write others off. I've been surprised by that. Chris can't do what he's done without having the X-factor which all great champions have."Tour of California: Adam Yates narrowly misses podium place

Yates, whose brother Simon leads the Giro d'Italia, was fourth, two seconds behind Colombian Daniel Martinez in third, going into the final day.
But a bunch sprint into Sacramento, won by Quick-Step's Fernando Gaviria, meant there were no movers in the field.
Team Sky's Colombian rider Egan Bernal won the overall race, while American Tejay van Garderen came second.
The BMC rider was one minute 25 seconds adrift of Bernal, who brought himself back into contention on a hilly stage six.
Martinez finished two minutes and 14 seconds behind the winner, while Sky's British rider Tao Geoghegan Hart finished 12 seconds behind Mitchelton-Scott rider Yates, 25, who is from Bury.
Team Sky took the team classification win, while Gaviria's stage seven win ensured the Colombian won the green jersey for best sprinter.Giro d'Italia: Elia Viviani wins stage 13 as Simon Yates retains lead

 Elia Viviani celebrates victory after crossing the line on stage 13
Friday's stage win was Viviani's third of this year's Giro
Italian sprinter Elia Viviani took his third stage win at the Giro d'Italia as Simon Yates kept his overall lead.
Viviani had endured a miserable day on Thursday but outkicked his rivals as the 180km stage to Nervesa della Battaglia ended in a bunch sprint.
With the infamous Zoncolan climb coming on Saturday this was an easy day for the contenders for the overall lead.
And Yates and main rival Tom Dumoulin finished safely in the bunch, the Briton's lead staying at 47 seconds.

Simon Yates' Giro d'Italia stage-by-stage guide
This flat stage always looked like one for the sprinters, but when unheralded Italian Marco Coledan launched a solo attack with a kilometre and a half to go he almost caught the lead-out trains napping.
Viviani had won the second and third stages of this Giro into Tel Aviv and Eilat but had struggled since, Ireland's Sam Bennett taking two sprint wins and closing to within 22 points of Viviani in the points classification.
But this time Viviani picked the correct line down the left hand side of the road as Danny van Poppel and Sacha Modolo led it out after Coledan had been sucked up, and his explosive power took him clear.
Bennett came late for second, kept off Viviani's wheel by the Italian's Quick-Step team-mate Zdenek Stybar.
Van Poppel held on for third, with Modolo left disappointed in fourth, thumping his handlebars in frustration as he crossed the line.
A defining few days for the British leader
Yates' Mitchelton-Scott team kept him towards the front of the bunch as the pace accelerated in the final 30km, and his thoughts now turn to the Zoncolan on Saturday afternoon.
Yates has enjoyed eight days in the race leader's maglia rosa and will hope to take more time out of reigning champion Dumoulin in the two mountainous stages that come before Monday's rest day.
Dumoulin, world time-trial champion, is expected to take at least a minute and a half out of Yates on Tuesday's 34.2km time-trial, but the Zoncolan could yet blow the general classification apart.
It averages 11.9% over its 10.1km length, with a maximum gradient of 22%, making it arguably the most feared climb in the Giro's history.
By comparison the Tour de France's Alpe d'Huez averages 8%, with a maximum of 12%, Mont Ventoux far longer at 21.5km but averaging just over 7%.
No Briton has ever won the Giro, and Yates knows that his own bid will be defined over the next few days before the race finishes in Rome on Sunday 27 May.Tour de Yorkshire: Astana sports director suspended after near miss

A support vehicle crashed through a traffic island during the final stage of the race.
The driver of the Astana team car that almost hit a volunteer and crashed through a traffic island during the Tour de Yorkshire has been suspended for 50 days.
Sports director Lars Michaelsen accepted responsibility and was also fined 5,000 Swiss Francs (£3,718) by the UCI, cycling's world governing body.
Astana apologised to race marshal Philip Sullivan, who was "shaken but unhurt" after the incident during the final stage in Leeds on 6 May.
Danish former rider Michaelsen, 49, will also help the UCI deliver driver safety initiatives and "share his experience as a driver in the race convoy", it said in a statement.
"The UCI emphasises the importance of continuously working on measures aimed at improving road safety as well as acting on any such incidents from a disciplinary point of view in a fair and efficient manner," it added.
Speaking after the incident, Mr Sullivan said he did not want it to "tarnish the the Tour de Yorkshire" and during his conversation with Michaelsen said that he would volunteer at next year's race, where the two will "meet for a beer".
He was one of hundreds of volunteer marshals working on the race and was standing on the traffic island in a hi-vis jacket, waving a flag to direct cyclists, their team cars and official race motorbikes, away from the hazard.
The Astana car came round a right-hand bend in the centre of the road and was unable to avoid the traffic island, with Mr Sullivan jumping clear at the .A group of youngsters from the valleys are "still on cloud nine" after winning a cheerleading competition in the US.

Brazilian gymnast Petrix Barbosa is among those who have accused Mr Lopes
Dozens of Brazilian gymnasts have alleged that the former coach of Brazil's national team, Fernando de Carvalho Lopes, sexually abused them.
They told TV Globo's Fantástico programme that they had experienced sexual abuse, ranging from touching to being told to shower in front of him.
He was removed from the national team just before the 2016 Olympics after the parents of a gymnast raised concerns.
Mr Lopes says that he has "a clear conscience".
Interviewed by TV Globo, he said that he had never molested anyone.
But on Monday, the club near São Paulo at which he had been training youngsters for two decades sacked Mr Lopes.
The club, MESC of São Bernardo do Campo, said Mr Lopes had already been moved to an "administrative position" two years ago when the first allegations against him emerged.
Only one gymnast agreed to speak to TV Globo on camera without having his face obscured. Petrix Barbosa, 26, said that: "I was woken up more than once by his hand down my pants."
Mr Barbosa, a Pan-American champion who now lives in the US, said that the coach asked gymnasts to show him their genitals.
"He always asked us how we were developing, he said that he needed to be across our growth so he could adapt our training accordingly," the gymnast said.
The programme spoke to 42 gymnasts who said that they had experienced some form of abuse at the hands of Mr Lopes.
They said that the alleged abuse happened before and after training sessions and during training camps.
Mr Lopes told the programme that those accusing him had yet to "present proof in court".
The BBC approached his lawyer for comment but has not received a response.
The allegations against him are being investigated by the prosecutor's office.
The scandal comes just months after the former doctor of the US gymnastics team, Larry Nassar, was jailed after more than 265 women accused him of abuse.Ellie Downie: Briton to undergo second surgery on left ankle

Halford was less than one point off the bronze medal, having posted a score of 50.650 overall.
Just 1.300 points further behind was nerveless 15-year-old Martin, who showed great potential for the future, particularly with her performance with the first apparatus, the hoop.
Meanwhile, Wales' Gemma Frizelle came 12th, with Stephani Sherlock of England 14th.

Alice Kinsella takes gold and Kelly Simm bronze for England on the individual beam final.
'We absolutely smashed it'
A third gold marked 22-year-old Wilson's fifth medal of the Games, having won all-around and men's team gold as well as rings silver behind Tulloch, also 22.
"I was struggling the last couple of days," said Wilson. "I am very, very exhausted right now. It has been amazing and a massive stepping stone for the future. It's been one of the greatest experiences I've ever had.
"I'm just happy to get through the last two days and do amazing gymnastics once again. It's been an amazing week for Team England. We absolutely smashed it."
Gold was 17-year-old Kinsella's third medal of the Games on Australia's Gold Coast following women's team silver and all-around bronze.
She scored 13.700 to take top spot on the beam with Simm, 22, only missing out on silver by 0.033 points - edged out by the final competitor, Australia's Georgia-Rose Brown.
"I'm still quite speechless. I don't really know what to say," said Kinsella. "I went out quite confident because I came second in qualifications. I thought if I go clean a medal was possible. But when I got the gold I didn't know what to do."
England finished the artistic gymnastics competition top of the medal table with 16, including six golds.

Commonwealth Games: Northern Ireland's McClenaghan beats Whitlock to pommel horse gold

Venue: Gold Coast, Australia Dates: 4-15 April

Northern Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan beat England's Max Whitlock to win his country's first medal of the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the pommel horse.
The two finished with scores of 15.100, but 18-year-old McClenaghan took gold over the Olympic champion thanks to better execution.
England's Georgia-Mae Fenton, 17, won a gold medal in the women's uneven bars with a score of 14.200.
Compatriot Courtney Tulloch, 22, scored 14.833 to win the men's rings final.
Englishman Nile Wilson claimed silver behind Tulloch with a score of 14.400, the 22-year-old capturing his third medal of the Games.
Whitlock, who helped England to the team gold on Thursday, began his day with a sixth-placed finish on the floor as Scotland's Dan Purvis won bronze.
Marios Georgiou of Cyprus took the floor title with a score of 13.966 as Canada's Scott Morgan won the silver medal.
Tulloch and Wilson win rings gold & silver
Olympic bronze medallist Purvis, 27, scored 13.733 as he won his second medal of the Games following a bronze in Thursday's team final.
His team-mate Hamish Carter came fourth, with English all-around champion Nile Wilson in last place.

It was a poor start to the day for England's gymnasts, who have been dominant until this point on the Gold Coast.
Wilson looked tired after his efforts to win gold in the all-around on the floor, while Whitlock's decision to sit out that event in favour of the floor and pommel finals may now be questioned.
Fenton wins high bar gold
The floor and pommel Olympic champion made one major mistake in his floor routine, before he was edged out by McClenaghan on his second apparatus of the day.
Instead, it was Scot Purvis who impressed for the home nations on the floor while McClenaghan's execution of 8.600 meant he saw off 25-year-old Whitlock (8.300).
Zachary Clay of Canada won the bronze.
McClenaghan described his gold medal as "a huge result".
"Max has been my idol growing up and I've been watching him since 2010 when he was competing in the Delhi Commonwealths," said the 18-year-old.
"I've always felt though that one day I could be up there with the best and beating them."
Fenton said: "It's my mum's birthday today and I was thinking about what I could get her as a present. I thought, 'hey, let me do my best and see'.

England's Nile Wilson won his second gold medal of the Commonwealth Games in the men's all-around final as his team-mate James Hall took silver.
Hall and Wilson won gold in the men's team final on Thursday and the two gymnasts continued their fine form in a closely fought competition.
Despite nursing a wrist injury, Wilson, 22, posted 15.100 on the horizontal bar to steal victory.
England's Alice Kinsella also claimed bronze in the women's all-around final.
The 17-year-old registered a combined total of 53.150 to finish third.
Canada's Elsabeth Black won gold, while Australia's Georgia Godwin claimed silver.
"I could have done a lot better today, my beam performance was quite wobbly, the floor landing was the same thing. So yes, I could have done better but I'm still proud of what I achieved," said Kinsella.

Nile Wilson went into the final rotation in joint-first place with Marios Georgiou of Cyprus, but maintained his composure to secure the title.
"That was one of the most incredible experiences I've ever had," said Wilson.
Alice Kinsella
Alice Kinsella was part of the England team who won women's team gymnastics silver on Friday
"It was a battle on the high bar. You can't write it, to finish the way like it did. That was one of the best high bars I have put together."
Wilson, the 2016 Olympic bronze medallist on the horizontal bar, finished with a final score of 84.950 to better his third place in Glasgow four years ago as Georgiou took the bronze.
Hall, 22, had temporarily moved into the gold medal position before Wilson pipped his team-mate on the final routine as England celebrated a deserved one-two.
Scotland's Frank Baines finished just outside the medals in fourth, with his compatriot Hamish Carter in sixth.
Northern Ireland's Rhys McClenaghan was 10th, Wales' Josh Cook came 13th and another Northern Irishman, Ewan McAteer, called up as a late reserve, came 18th.
Whitlock watches as Wilson wins
Nile Wilson gatecrashes interview with his father
In a scintillating competition on the Gold Coast, Leeds-born Wilson began as favourite in the absence of reigning all-around Commonwealth champion Max Whitlock.
England's Whitlock chose to sit out the event to focus on the individual floor and the pommel titles, and watched from the stands as his England team-mate took his title.
Wilson made slow and steady progress up the leaderboard after modest performances on the floor and the pommel - a routine that had to be adapted to accommodate his injury.
He was pushed all the way after a fine outing from Hall, and the English pair went into the final rotation with just 0.025 points between them, with Georgiou, who had led throughout, also matching Wilson's score.
Georgiou was a surprise contender for the title after a series of falls in the qualification round, but all three nailed their high bar routines in a tense finale.
And it was Olympic medallist Wilson who came out on top - much to the delight of his dad, who celebrated madly when he won.
"There were some tears from my dad," Wilson added.
"He pointed at me and said 'you're gifted, boy' and that got me. My family are the reason I do what I do. I just want to thank everyone back home."

Jersey gymnasts have 'made history' after all three of the island's team made the final of the all-around events at the Commonwealth Games.
Dan Lee finished 12th in the men's competition while Bonita Shurmer was 17th in the women's final, one place ahead of team-mate Rachelle Flambard.
"I couldn't be happier," Lee told BBC Radio Jersey after the final.
"To be competing on this stage was fantastic and to get 12th, I improved by five places from qualifying."

Flambard had initially missed out on qualifying, but after two people pulled out she competed with just two hours notice.
"I've just competed at the Commonwealth Games to such a high level. Little me from Jersey - that would never have happened even in my dreams," she said.
"When we all came out I don't think any of us thought that all of us were going to make the finals, it's something that Jersey's never done before so we made history and it's amazing."

England's gymnasts ensured it was two medals from as many events at the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast as they won women's team silver - a day after the men's team won gold.
The English team - Georgia-Mae Fenton, Lucy Stanhope, Alice Kinsella, Kelly Simm and Taeja James - posted a total score of 162.650 to finish second.
Canada won with a total score of 163.075 with Australia taking bronze.
Wales just missed out on the medals in fourth, while Scotland finished fifth.
Wilson and Whitlock shine as England win men's team gold
England's run up to the Games was marred by the late withdrawals of both Claudia Fragapane and Olympic bronze medallist Amy Tinkler - the latter being replaced by 15-year-old James for her major international debut.
But despite the absence of their more experienced team-mates - plus that of sisters Becky and Ellie Downie who were both not considered for the team after recent injuries - England performed consistently well with their only mistakes coming on the beam.
"It's very sad that the injuries occurred but it's really pulled us together as as team," said Fenton, 17.
"I'm just so proud of all the girls and I'm so happy to be standing on the podium with them."
Kinsella and Simm will compete in Saturday's all-around final, alongside Scotland's Shannon Archer and Cara Kennedy plus Welsh pair Latalia Bevan and Maisie Methuen.

Scotland's gymnasts "dug deep right at the end" to collect Commonwealth Games bronze, says team captain Dan Purvis.
A strong finish secured a podium finish behind England and Canada.
"We started off with one or two hiccups but I'm just fantastically proud of everyone, how we fought and how much we had to come back," said Purvis.
"It was hard to come back on that podium from Glasgow with a different team but we've done it and it's fantastic."
Frank Baines, who helped Scotland to a team silver medal at Glasgow 2014, was last to take to the floor as the Scots secured a points tally of 240.975.
England finished with 258 points, 10 marks clear of Canada.
"I think floor is probably one of our better pieces so we knew it was a higher scoring piece, but anything can happen under competition," said Baines.
And the 22-year-old was also full of praise for all three of Team Scotland's Commonwealth Games debutants - Hamish Carter, David Weir and Kelvin Cham.
Baines and Carter, 19, will compete in the all-around final but Purvis, 27, missed out after failing to land his vault.

"Credit to Kelvin for being out here in the first place with his ankle injury from the British, it was just a real hard graft for him," said Baines.
"And then for David filling in when Kelvin got injured, I think he's the real MVP [most valuable player] today."
Weir's family had travelled from Dreghorn, North Ayrshire, to Australia's Gold Coast to support the 19-year-old.
"My mum, dad and sister came over from so they were pretty excited because it was their first time in Australia," Weir told BBC Scotland.
It was also a "huge" moment for team-mate Carter.
"I missed out on my first major (championships) a few years ago due to injury, and to come back and do the performances I know I can do, it's everything I've been thinking of since I first missed out on it," he said.

England took the top three spots in the all-around standings in the team event, but only two competitors from each country can qualify for the individual final, meaning Dominick Cunningham misses out.
Team-mate Whitlock was not in contention to make the all-around final as he only competed in the final two apparatus on Thursday, by which time England's retention of the title was already all but assured.
"It was quite a different experience for me dropping to two pieces," said Whitlock.
"It was difficult but it's something I've learned from this competition. The team did incredibly well and I'm really pleased with what we've done," he added.
Hamish Carter, 19, finished in fifth place and will compete in the all-around final for Scotland alongside Frank Baines.
Fellow Scot and Olympic bronze medallist Dan Purvis failed to land his vault and although he delivered a great floor performance, it was not enough to seal qualification for the all-around final.

From triathlete Lauren Parker, paralysed less than 12 months ago, to swimmer Chad le Clos, aiming to become the most decorated male Commonwealths competitor of all time, there are compelling stories to follow among the global names competing on the Gold Coast.
There is also a double Olympic champion aiming to break the oldest track world record and a boxer whose two brothers - one of them a Commonwealth boxing medallist - died in a car accident before she was born.
We have taken a look at some of the big names who will be in action in Australia...
Athletics
Sally Pearson (Australia)
Sally Pearson
Sally Pearson failed to reach the final of the 60m hurdles at the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham in March
There is usually a poster girl or boy at a major championships and on the Gold Coast that title belongs to Sally Pearson, the London 2012 Olympic 100m hurdles champion and two-time world and Commonwealth gold medallist.
Pearson, who spent most of her childhood in Queensland, overcame three injury-riddled years to take a shock World Championship gold in London last summer. She was tweeted by actor Russell Crowe on Wednesday, who, in the wake of Australia's cricket ball-tampering scandal, wrote: "Come on Sally Pearson, you can do it. We need you Sally. Heroes are hard to find around these parts these days."
No pressure, then.
Elaine Thompson (Jamaica)
Jamaica's Elaine Thompson
Thompson became the first female Jamaican sprinter to win the 100m and 200m Olympic titles at the 2016 Rio Games
Usain Bolt may have retired but Jamaica still has an Olympic champion sprinter on the world stage.
Elaine Thompson joined the list of athletics greats when she achieved the 100m and 200m sprint double at Rio 2016. However, in the 2017 World Championships the 25-year-old only managed fifth in the 100m final after a poor start.
Thompson says she is using the Commonwealth Games to prepare for the Diamond League this summer and will only run in the 200m and 4x100m relay on the Gold Coast.
Women's 200m final: 12 April; 4x100m final: 14 April
Caster Semenya (South Africa)
Semenya wins 800m gold as Sharp comes eighth
Could South Africa's most decorated athlete break the oldest track world record on the Gold Coast?
Caster Semenya is hot favourite to achieve the 800m and 1500m double in Australia, and has set herself a target in 2018 of bettering Jarmila Kratochvilova's 1983 800m mark of one minute 53.28 seconds.
The 27-year-old double Olympic champion and triple world champion is competing in her first Commonwealths having missed Delhi 2010 and Glasgow 2014 because of injuries.
Women's 1500m final: 10 April; 800m final: 13 April
Valerie Adams (New Zealand)
New Zealand's Valerie Adams
Adams currently holds the women's Commonwealth shot put record with a personal best throw of 21.24m
This could be the final Games for one its most successful athletes.
New Zealand's Valerie Adams arrives on the Gold Coast as the three-time Commonwealth shot put champion.
She also arrives having given birth to her daughter Kimoana only six months ago.
The 33-year-old double Olympic gold medallist and four-time world champion recently said: "It will definitely make the moment more special to win a medal with my daughter."
Women's shot put final: 13 April
Issac Makwala (Botswana)
One-man race! Makwala reaches 200m semi-finals
One athlete who commanded almost as many headlines as Usain Bolt at the 2017 World Championships was Isaac Makwala.
The 31-year-old was strongly fancied to win a medal in London but was prevented from competing in the 400m final because he was suspected of having norovirus, and was initially deemed unfit for the 200m heats too. However, the Botswana sprinter recovered to qualify for the semis by competing in an individual time trial, before eventually finishing sixth in the final. It was a saga that will live long in the memory.
Makwala will compete only in the 400m, an event in which he was eliminated at the semi-final stage four years ago, and he said: "Scotland was too cold for me. I thought I could race to get a medal, but I don't perform well in that kind of weather. Australia should suit me better."
Men's 400m final: 10 April
Boxing
Skye Nicolson (Australia)
Australia's Skye Nicolson
Nicolson won World Championship bronze in 2017, 27 years after her brother Gavin became the first Australian to win a medal at a World Championship in Moscow in 1989
There will be a huge cheer when 22-year-old Skye Nicolson takes to the canvas in her first 57kg fight, with the Gold Coast Games only 15 miles from her Yatala family home.
For Nicolson, who narrowly missed out on a place at the Rio 2016 Olympics, the home Commonwealths will have an extra significance.
Her promising boxer brother Jamie won bronze at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland. But both he and younger brother Gavin died in a car accident on their way to boxing training in 1994 - a year before she was born.
Women's 57kg final: 14 April
Gymnastics
Rakesh Patra (India)
India's Rakesh Patra
Rakesh Patra finished fourth in the recently concluded World Cup on the Gold Coast
This Indian gymnast's story is worthy of the big-screen treatment.
The 26-year-old had to go to the Delhi High Court to argue his right to be in the country's Commonwealth Games team after he was originally omitted because of a rift between the sport's national federation and India's Olympic federation.
In a recent article Patra said his family home was burned down when he was aged five and that his parents went without food in order to fund his gymnastics career.
Patra has been competing in major championships since 2010 but has yet to win a medal. However, he finished fourth on the rings in February's World Cup in Melbourne - behind competitors from China and Japan, who will not be at the Gold Coast Games.
Men's rings final: 8 April
Netball

The 23-year-old Melbourne Vixens wing attack won the Young Star award in the inaugural season of Australia's Super Netball league after a phenomenal 288 goal assists.
Australia are favourites to retain their title and arguably have the best mid-courter in world netball.

Swimming
Emma McKeon (Australia)
Australia's Emma McKeon
Emma McKeon equalled a record held by Ian Thorpe, among others, of winning six medals at a single Commonwealth Games in Glasgow
Four years ago in Glasgow, Wollongong-born Emma McKeon won four gold medals among Australia's haul of 19 in swimming - she is aiming for six this time.
The 2014 200m freestyle champion is due to take part in three individual events and three relays.
Women's 200m freestyle final: 5 April; 4x100m freestyle relay final: 5 April; 100m butterfly final: 6 April; 4x200m freestyle final: 7 April; 200m butterfly final: 9 April; 4x100m medley final: 10 April
Chad le Clos (South Africa)

Perhaps a swimmer who is better known to a wider audience is South Africa's Chad le Clos. The Durban-born swimmer inadvertently took centre stage at London 2012 when his father Bert's emotions poured out in front of a live BBC TV audience after his son beat Michael Phelps to win the 200m butterfly title.
The 25-year-old is targeting an incredible eight Commonwealth titles - at Glasgow 2014 he won a medal in all seven events he entered, including two golds (100m and 200m butterfly).
If he wins medals in each of his events then he could become the most successful male Commonwealth competitor of all time. The current record of 18 is held by shooters Mick Gault and Philip Adams from six Games - Le Clos has 12 from two.

Since making her Paralympic debut aged 15 in Beijing in 2008, Pascoe has become New Zealand's most successful Paralympian with nine gold medals, as well as 13 world titles and two Commonwealth golds from Glasgow four years ago.
Pascoe lost her lower left leg in an accident aged two when her father ran over her with a ride-on lawnmower at their home and she was left with severe scarring to her right leg. She started competitive swimming when she was seven and while she is favourite for her medley race, she will find the going tougher in the breaststroke event.

The woman known as Milly is used to creating firsts - in 2014 she became the first Australian Paralympic athlete to qualify for an able-bodied national team, winning Commonwealth Games bronze in the team event.
Two years later she became the first Australian to compete at both the Olympics and Paralympics and now she is the first Australian to compete at a Commonwealth Games in Para-sport and able-bodied events.
Born with Erbs palsy, a condition which affects her right shoulder and arm, restricting her serving action, Tapper will have a busy schedule over the 11 days of competition as she chases medals.

Twelve months ago, competing at the Commonwealth Games was not part of Parker's plans. But last April, while on a training cycle before Ironman Australia, she crashed into a guard rail at 45mph and was left paralysed from the waist down, as well as suffering broken ribs, a punctured lung, a broken scapula and a broken pelvis.
The 29-year-old refused to abandon her sporting dreams, and nine months after the accident she took part in her first Para-triathlon. Now she will hope to land a medal on home soil with the sport making its Commonwealth Games debut.

The 39-year-old weightlifter Laurel Hubbard competed as Gavin before undergoing gender reassignment at the age of 35.
The Australian Weightlifting Federation wanted Hubbard banned but the International Weightlifting Federation said it did not discriminate against transgender athletes. Hubbard has passed strict criteria around testosterone levels.
Hubbard will compete in the +90kg category - she comes into the event in good form having won two silver medals in December's World Championships.

Epsom Derby: Roaring Lion confirmed to race by trainer John Gosden

Date: Saturday 2 June Venue: Epsom Time: 16:30 BST Coverage: Commentary on BBC Radio 5 live
Roaring Lion, the current second favourite for the Epsom Derby on 2 June has been confirmed as a definite runner by trainer John Gosden.
The winner of last week's Dante Stakes was considered for the Prix du Jockey Club - France's equivalent of the Classic, a day later.
Aidan O'Brien's Saxon Warrior is the odds-on favourite for the Epsom race.
"He is in great form and I hope he can get involved with Saxon Warrior," said Gosden.
"We were pleased with the horse [after the Dante], he ate up.
"The owner [Qatar Racing] is very keen that he goes for the Derby, so that is where he is going and I think that's the right call."
Roaring Lion lost by a neck to Saxon Warrior in last year's Racing Post Trophy at Newbury, a major race for two-year-olds.
But this season, he was a disappointing third on his seasonal reappearance in the Craven Stakes at Newmarket before finishing fifth in the 2,000 Guineas at the same track behind Saxon Warrior.
However, Gosden hopes after the comfortable win at York that he can challenge his rival over the mile-and-a-half at Epsom.

Saxon Warrior is aiming to win the Epsom race and move closer to the British racing Triple Crown of the Guineas, Derby and St Leger, a feat not achieved since Nijinsky in 1970.
Speaking at the Breakfast with the Stars event at Epsom on Tuesday, O'Brien issued a positive update on the horse who is hoping to provide him with a seventh success in the Derby at Epsom.
"We are happy with Saxon Warrior and it's so far, so good with all the possibles," he said.
"We always thought he was a very high-quality colt and he's done everything right so far.
"He's a very strong blend of Danehill, Galileo and Deep Impact. We haven't had anything like him before. He's exciting."Faugheen vet Tim Brennan charged with passing on inside information

 Faugheen won the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2015
Faugheen won the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham in 2015
A leading Irish vet has been accused of passing on inside information before top hurdler Faugheen's withdrawal from the 2016 Cheltenham Festival.
Tim Brennan, who is alleged to have conspired with his brother Michael, has been charged by the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) and could face a ban.
Michael is alleged to have placed 'lay bets' against the horse for the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham.
Faugheen's trainer Willie Mullins is not accused of any wrongdoing.
Everyone who knows me is aware that I don't gamble or give information to those who do
Tim Brennan
Tim Brennan issued a statement in which he said the allegations were based on "extraordinarily tenuous evidence".
"The BHA is aware that I have denied all wrongdoing and will vigorously contest these unfounded allegations," he said,
"In such circumstances, I would have thought that the principals of natural justice would dictate that no publication occur prior to the final determination by the disciplinary panel."
Faugheen, nicknamed 'The Machine', won the Champion Hurdle in March 2015 but was ruled out of a title defence the following February with a leg injury.
A disciplinary panel will consider the case on 16 and 17 July.
Vet's brother barred from racecourses
Michael Brennan has refused to cooperate with the BHA's investigation and was excluded from the sport in October 2016, meaning he is barred from entering racecourses or racing stables.
"This failure to comply has resulted in the investigation process taking longer than it otherwise would have done," said BHA chief regulatory officer Brant Dunshea.
"However, it has ultimately not prevented us from bringing charges and has also seen the individual ejected from the sport in Britain."
The hearing will assess whether or not Tim Brennan passed on information "which might be used to gain an unfair advantage in the betting market intending to make a gain for himself or another and/or to cause loss to another".
The panel will also consider whether or not Tim Brennan "enabled and/or assisted Michael Brennan to cheat at gambling in relation to the 2016 Cheltenham Champion Hurdle".
If found guilty of an offence, Tim Brennan could be disqualified from the sport for between six months to 10 years. The BHA would ask for any penalty to be reciprocated in Ireland.
But he said: "I reiterate that I have and will continue to deny these allegations vigorously and will clear my name before the disciplinary panel when it meets in July 2018.
"Everyone who knows me is aware that I don't gamble or give information to those who do."Preakness Stakes: Justify on course for Triple Crown after victory at Pimlico

 Justify wins the Preakness Stakes
Justify prevailed in wet conditions at Pimlico
Kentucky Derby winner Justify won the Preakness Stakes on Saturday and is on course to become the 13th horse to win US flat racing's Triple Crown.
Unbeaten in five starts, Justify can complete the coveted treble at the Belmont Stakes on June 9.
The Bob Baffert-trained Justify, ridden by Mike Smith, was pressed all the way by Kentucky Derby runner-up Good Magic.
But the 1-2 favourite had enough at the end to seize the victory before a crowd of 134,487 at Pimlico in Baltimore.
"Oh man, it was a nail-biter," said Baffert, whose seventh Preakness victory saw him tie 19th-century trainer Robert Wyndham Walden for the all-time record.
Baffert also matched D Wayne Lukas's record of 14 victories in the Triple Crown races -- the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes.
It was Baffert who saddled American Pharoah in 2015 when the three-year-old became the first horse in 37 years to win all three.Lockinge Stakes: Rhododendron beats Lightning Spear in photo finish at Newbury

 Rhododendron
Rhododendron was given victory ahead of Lightning Spear in a close finish
Favourite Rhododendron beat Lightning Spear by a short head to become the first filly since Red Evie in 2007 to win the Group One Lockinge Stakes.
It was a thrilling climax, with the Aidan O'Brien-trained four-year-old given the win following a photo finish.
"After what happened at the French Oaks [pulled up], and what Aidan has done with her - it's a massive turnaround," jockey Ryan Moore told ITV Sport.
Another O'Brien runner, Lancaster Bomber, finished third.
Moore, who won the Newbury race for the first time, added: "She's been a great filly at two, three and now four.
"It's testament to everyone who puts in the hard work at home. She's been unfortunate not to have won more in her time.
"She's very adaptable with ground, distance and has got a great attitude."
Analysis
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
Aidan O'Brien believes this will have put Rhododendron just right for either the Queen Anne or the Prince of Wales's Stakes at Royal Ascot.
But, wherever she does go, there's little doubt the filly, who overcame the potential hindrance of finding herself racing alone for the final quarter-mile or so, will be another significant player for team O'Brien.
What a gallant performance from the likeable Lightning Spear, runner-up - or should we say on this particular day 'pageboy' - for the second year running.York: Stradivarius eases to Yorkshire Cup victory

 Stradivarius ridden by Frankie Dettori
Stradivarius comfortably won at York by three lengths
Stradivarius is second favourite for the Gold Cup at Ascot, with odds of 11-4, after winning the Yorkshire Cup.
Desert Skyline in second and third-place Call To Mind had no response to a late burst from John Gosden's charge ridden by Frankie Dettori.
It was the four-year-old's first race since October.
"He's a star - it's very rare you get a stayer with a turn of foot, but that is what he has got," said Dettori.
"It's a deadly combination. It is a great weapon to have over this distance and he's a force to be reckoned with now."
Stradivarius is now behind 9-4 favourite Order Of St George for Ascot next month.
"He is the young pretender in the Gold Cup, with fresh legs, and he's on the way up," Dettori added.
Analysis
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
Stradivarius demonstrated his Gold Cup potential with a comfortable success; Frankie Dettori didn't ask a serious question until late, and the answer was a very satisfactory burst of speed.
Although no one can be cast-iron sure about the horse's stamina over the marathon two and a half miles of the Royal Ascot centrepiece, the trainer pointed out a relaxed demeanour will give him every chance of 'getting the trip'.
Stradivarius wasn't the only one to put in a good trial - runner-up Desert Skyline, with a bit more weight and racing over a shorter distance than ideal - ran very nicely too.Jockey Charlie Deutsch jailed after high-speed police pursuit

Charlie Deutsch was found to be a little less than one and a half times the legal alcohol limit
A top jockey who drove away from police at up to 114mph after a roadside breath test has been jailed for 10 months.
The drama unfolded when Charlie Deutsch, 21, was pulled over in Cheltenham after a night out in March.
He took six attempts to blow into a breathalyser before he was arrested, Gloucester Crown Court heard.
At this point Deutsch ran back to his Audi, which had other jockeys inside, and sped off. He was then pursued by police for nearly five miles.
The court heard how Sgt Marcus Forbes-George had tried to stop him at the roadside by smashing the driver's door to take the ignition key, and the officer hurt his arm during his attempt to immobilise the fleeing jockey.
'Remarkably stupid'
Deutsch's vehicle was eventually stopped with a stinger, the court heard.
During the chase, in the early hours of 30 March, he drove the wrong way around a roundabout and on the wrong side of the road.

The jockey, from Beckford Road in Tewkesbury, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving while over the legal alcohol limit and escaping from police custody.
In mitigation, the court was told by Deutsch's lawyer he was a "sensible young man" who had "done something remarkably stupid".
Sentencing the young horseman, Recorder James Watson QC told him his conduct had been "outrageous".
"Those who resist arrest involving violent struggles and cause injury to police officers must not expect a custodial sentence to be suspended," he said.
Deutsch, who fell while riding Houblon Des Obeaux in this Year's Grand National, was also disqualified from driving for 17 months.How to commentate on the Grand National

The winning jockey in the 2018 Grand National achieved a lifelong dream.
The oldest jockey in the race on the smallest horse. That was the partnership which won the 2018 Grand National at Aintree.
Tiger Roll, the diminutive gelding with the heart of a lion, held on by a head from the fast-finishing Pleasant Company in a dramatic photo finish.
It was an emotional triumph for jockey Davy Russell, winning the National for the first time at his 14th attempt just weeks after the death of his beloved mother and birth of his fourth child, Liam.
"When the commentator said going out that I was the oldest jockey in the race, I thought: 'Jeez, I better not come back next year,'" joked the 38-year-old.
Trainer Gordon Elliott was called a "genius" afterwards - and it was hard to argue after developing a little hurdler into the victor of the world's most famous steeplechase.
This was a second success for him, after Silver Birch in 2007, and also for owner Michael O'Leary, the airline boss who triumphed with Rule The World two years ago.
And Irish trainers enjoyed a green sweep - with the first four home. Tiger Roll's stablemate Bless The Wings was third, ahead of Anibale Fly.
Much of the pre-race coverage was dominated by three female jockeys bidding to become the first to win. Bryony Frost fared best, finishing a creditable fifth on Milansbar.
Redemption for Russell

Davy Russell receives congratulations after his victory
Russell lost his role as stable jockey to Ryanair chief O'Leary's powerful Gigginstown House Stud operation at the end of 2013.
The departure came over a cup of tea at Punchestown racecourse, and it would have been easy for the jockey to cry over spilt milk.
But he regrouped, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup three months later on Lord Windermere, and says he is happier now than earlier in his career when he over-analysed his performances.
After winning the world's most famous jumps race on 10-1 chance Tiger Roll, he dedicated victory to Flat jockey Pat Smullen, who has been diagnosed with a tumour.
"I've won this race a thousand times in my head, in my dreams as a child," he said, recalling how he built pretend National fences out of grass as a child when the garden was mowed.
"We would have races over them and kick the grass into the air like the spruce flying."
His mother, Phyllis, died shortly before last month's Cheltenham Festival and he paid tribute to her.
"She was always there throughout my career. She was a very kind woman - I never heard her curse. She was such a lady and a role model. It's a pity she's not here," he said.
O'Leary hailed the man he is still happy to hire, despite firing him from the full-time role.
"We parted company after the most legendary cup of tea in Irish racing, but what stands out is his resilience, the way he keeps coming back," he said.
Russell showed some of that resilience to recover from criticism last summer when he was given a four-day suspension for aiming a blow at his mount Kings Dolly, after the horse pulled up at a pre-race 'show' hurdle at Tramore.
The jockey had argued he wanted the horse to concentrate and it was inappropriate to use the whip in those circumstances.

Still only 40, Elliott continues his remarkable rise from journeyman jockey to top trainer.
He was leading trainer at the Cheltenham Festival last month for the second successive year.
And here he won the most famous race in jump racing with the eight-year-old son of Authorized, a winner of Flat racing's Derby at Epsom in 2007.
Elliott's right-hand man Mouse O'Ryan told BBC Sport: "Gordon's just different, he's a genius. I don't think he even knows how he does it.
"With Tiger Roll, he has won three times at the Cheltenham Festival, starting with the Triumph Hurdle four years ago and also the Cross-Country Chase last month.
"He keeps his horses going. They are fit and healthy, and they last."
O'Ryan also had a word for Russell.
"I'd say he's a happier man. It's probably down to old age. He's settled with a wife and kids and probably riding better than ever before. He breeds horses and he loves horses," he said.
Elliott was happy, saying he would enjoy this success more as he was too young the first time round, and could afford a little dig at O'Leary.
"I'm going home on the boat, the Ryanair flights were too expensive," he said.
He missed out on a rare treat from O'Leary for fellow passengers on the flight back to Ireland.
The airline tycoon announced to cheers: "Unusually aboard this flight, there's going to be a free bar."

There was drama from the off as the race took place in the softest conditions since 2001 after rain on Merseyside in the build-up.
Top weight Blaklion was brought down at the first fence, while the well-backed I Just Know fell at the sixth, Becher's Brook.
The obstacle was bypassed on the second circuit as jockey Charlie Deutsch was attended to after a fall, but he was not seriously injured.
Saint Are, who was brought down at The Chair - the 15th of 30 fences - was set to go back to his stables in Gloucestershire after being assessed at Aintree on Saturday night.
It is the sixth consecutive year all the runners have returned safely.
As the race over 30 fences and four and a quarter miles unfolded, Russell and Tiger Roll took charge and looked set for a convincing success before the lead rapidly diminished as he was reeled in by Pleasant Company under David Mullins for his trainer uncle Willie.
After a photo finish, Tiger Roll was given the decision by a head - the closest verdict since Neptune Collonges won by a nose six years ago.
"I saw an awful lot of Pleasant Company going by me," joked a relieved Russell afterwards.
Mullins, winner on Rule The World in 2016, showed maturity beyond his years after an agonising defeat.
"I was sick for a couple of seconds afterwards, but told myself that Davy Russell is 38 and had never won the race - but I won it when I was 19," he said.
The winner showed good things can come in small packages.
"It depends on the size of the engine," reflected Russell. "A Ferrari is a lot smaller than a Range Rover."

 Victory for Bob Davies on Lucius at Aintree came in a five-horse finish, one of the National's tightest-ever
Victory for Bob Davies on Lucius at Aintree came in a five-horse finish, one of the National's tightest-ever
Randox Health Grand National
Date: 14 April Venue: Aintree Racecourse Time: 17:15 BST
Meeting: 12-14 April Coverage: BBC Radio 5 live, sports extra and sport website. More details
Bob Davies would have been forgiven for rolling up at Aintree on 1 April 1978 thinking he did not have much chance of winning the Grand National.
Lucius was only the Shropshire jockey's fourth ride in the race - and he had previously only got round the 30 fences once on National day.
He had originally been booked to ride at Towcester that day.
He had never sat on his horse in a race, having only inherited the spare ride when Lucius's regular pilot Dave Goulding was injured in a fall at Wetherby five days before the race.
And, perhaps most dishearteningly of all, he was to be up against Red Rum.
A year earlier when the great Rummy won for the third and final time, Davies, on Duffle Coat, had fallen at the first fence - one of seven fallers.
But fate was to have a fortuitous twist or two for Davies.
The legendary Red Rum, by then almost 13 years of age, was withdrawn on the morning of the race having suffered a hairline fracture the day before.
It was no April Fool's joke. Suddenly, the field was reduced by one. And, for Davies, it turned into a triumph that is still billed to this day as "one of the best spare rides in history".
Following his famous third and last Grand National win a year earlier, Red Rum was entered again in 1978 but withdrew on the morning of the race
Following his famous third and last Grand National win a year earlier, Red Rum was entered again in 1978 but withdrew on the morning of the race
Not that Davies ever doubted his chances, whether Red Rum had been fit or not.
"I was a bit lucky," he told BBC Sport. "But only in the way I got the ride. Make no mistake about it, Lucius was a very good winner.
"Dave Goulding should have ridden him for Gordon Richards, as he was his jockey, but he hurt his back at Wetherby on the Monday.
"I was at Wetherby on the Tuesday and one of the other jockeys Ron Barry said to me 'Do you have a spare ride in the National?'
"I told him I was actually due to go to Towcester that day but he said 'Well, Lucius is going spare. I'll have a word with Gordon.'
"I went back that night to look at his form, which showed he was best over two and a half miles but that he had also won over three and didn't like being in front. He'd got a live chance."
And so it proved in one of Aintree's best finishes.
How O'Sullevan called it...
Having taken the lead following the fall of the much-fancied Tied Cottage on the first circuit, Davies allowed Lucius to drop back behind the leaders as per instructions. But the Cumbria-trained horse was to prove the best finisher.
What's it like to call the Grand National?
Taking up the words of BBC racing legend Peter O'Sullevan...
"Just over a furlong to run, and it's Lucius and Bob Davies now just taking an advantage... The Pilgarlic running fast on the far side... But it's Lucius from Sebastian as they race into the closing stages... Lucius from Sebastian... with Drumroan putting in a tremendous finish... But at the line... Lucius wins the National..."
As current champion jockey Richard Johnson found out only a year ago, being top of your profession does not guarantee any jockey a ride in the Grand National.
Despite having three times been champion jockey, Davies only rode in the great race seven times.
A year after winning on Lucius, he nearly did it again, picking up another spare ride to finish a close second on Zongalero behind the winner Rubstic. But his eighth-place finish on Prophecy in 1973, the year of Red Rum's first victory over Crisp, was the only other time he completed the 30-fence course.
He also fell on Beecham in 1968, pulled up on The Vintner in 1980 and fell again at the sixth on Royal Mail in 1982, the year he retired.
Davies on Aintree now
"Aintree will always have a special place in my heart," said Davies, who carried on his connection by working for the BBC as a summariser. "The race has changed.
"It's living on its past a bit. Although it's lot easier there, it's not necessarily any quicker.
"Some of the alterations have been right. Some I don't agree with."
The modern-day Becher's Brook is not quite as imposing an obstacle as it was on Bob Davie's prime but it still takes some jumping
The modern-day Becher's Brook is not quite as imposing an obstacle as it was at Davies' prime but it still takes some jumping
The most famous horseracing obstacle of them - Becher's Brook - accounted painfully for Davies just once, in a Foxhunters' Chase. And he admits it is now not quite such a fence to be feared.
"The fences are a lot easier now," he said. "They changed a lot while I was still riding.
"The biggest change to Becher's was not filling in the drop but moving the outside rail because the horses then jumped the fence straight. Before that, they were jumping into the crowd.
"The first year after they made the changes, there were two hoof prints on the ground that had been built up. Everything else cleared it because they were jumping straighter.
"You couldn't have the fences as they were 40 years ago, as it wouldn't be acceptable today. But I hope it doesn't become just another long-distance chase."
Life after racing
Davies, the son of a Shropshire farmer, began life just south of the county town Shrewsbury, in 1947.
While still being educated at Sandhurst, he rode his first winner at the popular Eyton Point-to-Point races as a 14-year-old on Easter Monday 1961.
It was also over Easter in 1966 that he rode his first winner under National Hunt rules, at Newton Abbot.
And he went on to become champion jockey three times, sharing it with Terry Biddlecombe in 1968-69, before winning it outright the following season, then again in 1971-72.
After his painful final fall on Royal Mail and retirement in 1982, his main intention was to return to the family farm, but he instead became one of the first professional jockeys to go into racecourse management.
It is a job he has now done at his local course Ludlow for over 35 years, mostly as clerk to the course - and now as general manager, after Simon Sherwood succeeded him as clerk to the course in 2014.

"It wasn't planned," he explained. "I never wanted to train when I finished riding.
"But I was always interested in the admin side. And then John Williams, one of the directors at Ludlow, phoned and asked are you interested in taking over as clerk to the course at Ludlow and Bangor when John Moody retires.
"I started working alongside him, then took over when John went in May 1984. I did Bangor for about 12 years and I'm still here at Ludlow.
"I tried to do it on the philosophy by which I was brought up by my dad from farming. You live for today or tomorrow, but you farm as if you live forever."
It was a course he rode on seldom in his early racing days when, while still at agricultural college, he rode in a lot more races than he attended lectures while riding for West Country trainer Les Kennard.
"I didn't have that many rides at Ludlow as the people I rode for raced in the south," he said.
But he has become one of the most recognisable features of the popular and still profitable South Shropshire track.
"Whatever you do, you hope that, when you finish, it's better than when you started," he said. "People enjoy themselves, we don't rip anyone off, we give value for money and try to improve facilities as and when we can afford to.
"We've improved the stables, built two new stands, we've had help from the Levy board, with no outside finances and no debt.
"I've been very lucky that I have done my hobby all my working life."Get Inspired: How to get into horse riding and horse racing

Oliver Townend is looking to become only the third rider to win the Grand Slam
Britain's Oliver Townend is on course to land eventing's richest prize after he won the Kentucky three-day event in the United States.
The British number one won on Cooley Master Class, beating Germany's Olympic champion Michael Jung.
Townend won September's Burghley Horse Trials and victory in Kentucky means he is in on for the Rolex Grand Slam.
It has only been achieved on two previous occasions, by Jung and Britain's Pippa Funnell.
It carries a £255,000 prize and is awarded to any rider who wins consecutive Burghley, Kentucky and Badminton crowns.
Townend, 35, will head to Badminton next week among the major title challengers, with his Burghley champion horse Ballaghmor Class.
It was the fourth time Townend, who helped Great Britain take European team gold in Poland last September, has won an elite four-star event, collecting just over £90,000 for his efforts.

A study by the Animal Health Trust is looking into rising weight of riders and the effect on horses
A horse-trekking firm says it is having to close - in part - because riders are getting too fat.
Numbers of people turned away from Babeny Farm on Dartmoor because they broke weight restrictions has risen by about 30% in the past seven years.
Boss Dee Dee Wilkinson said the trend puts the animals' health at risk and she cannot afford to buy larger horses.
It comes after a study by the Animal Health Trust into the impact of riders being too heavy for their horses.
More on this story and others from Devon
Ms Wilkinson said: "We are finding increasingly that people are getting heavier, so we are unable to let them ride as it isn't fair on the horses."

Dee Dee Wilkinson said: "We're not about ostracizing a part of society, it's simply for the safety of the horses and the riders"
Danger to the horses include back injuries and lameness.
Riders are asked their height and weight before booking, but anyone over 16 stone is turned away.

Anyone who is clinically obese is also turned away because of the risk they could not handle a bigger horse.
Ms Wilkinson, who has 13 horses, said the increase in overweight riders was one of the reasons for the trekking firm announcing it is to close.
She said the main reasons were term-time restrictions on when families can take holidays and rising insurance costs.
'Simply for safety'
"Obesity has become really noticeable over the last seven years and it has been increasing," said Ms Wilkinson who gets about 40 customers over an average summer weekend.
"I've had 5ft (1.5m) tall people who are 16 stone (102kg) and a 12-year-old who was 12 stone (76kg) and we don't have the horses for them," she said.
"We are also getting more people who are 18-25 stone (114-156kg).
She added: "We're not about ostracizing a part of society, it's simply for the safety of the horses and the riders."

By Patrick Nathanson

Salmon says she experienced 'distressing' intimidation
The ex-chief executive of the British Equestrian Federation (BEF) was the victim of bullying and elitism while in the role, an investigation has found.
Clare Salmon raised "serious concerns" over "culture and governance" at the BEF in her resignation letter in July.
An independent investigation was then launched by the BEF.
"The report has vindicated the concerns I raised about bullying, about elitism and about a toxic culture within the equestrian world," she said.
"The intimidation that I experienced was very distressing. I am a strong character, as the report observes, but certainly being treated in this way, I was set up to fail.
"I was systematically prevented from implementing the vision that I set out, to democratise horse sport in the UK.
"That was very, very distressing. I was trolled online at various points during this process and I can only say that without the support of my husband and my daughter, I'm not sure where that would have finished."
Referring to the accusations of elitism she said: "At one of the board meetings that I attended with one of my colleagues, we said that we wanted to open up horse sport to a wider audience and we were told: 'But just anybody might turn up, think who might turn up, how terrible might that be' - people who were beyond the sort of tweedocracy of traditional horse sport."
The BEF oversees 15 member bodies (MBs), including those responsible for Olympic sports showjumping, dressage and eventing.
It is the latest governing body to face claims over its sport's culture, after reviews at British Cycling,British Swimming and British Bobsleigh.
Salmon had also accused the BEF of corruption but those allegations were not found proven.
The Sport Resolutions UK investigation, chaired by lawyer John Mehrzad, concluded that "certain actions can, in the panel's opinion, be objectively viewed as bullying, elitist and arising from self-interest but not corruption".
The report makes recommendations that centre on three key areas: the identification of the role and responsibilities of the BEF; the establishment of strong leadership within the BEF; and the maintenance of good governance.
It also recommends that the BEF adopts a code of conduct that all MBs and the BEF are required to sign up to as a condition of public funding. Also that "any disciplinary, grievance or whistle-blowing type complaints and private meetings must be dealt with confidentially".
BEF interim chair Ed Warner said: "We are grateful for the work of the panel and accept, in full, the recommendations arising from its independent review, which identified difficulties in relationships within the BEF.
"It is now a priority for the BEF, which is under the leadership of both a new board of directors and executive management, to learn lessons from the past and ensure appropriate practices in future."
'Relieved and sad'
Speaking to BBC Sport, Salmon said she felt vindicated by the findings of the report.
"I think I am both relieved and sad," she said.
"I'm very relieved that the report has vindicated the concerns I raised about bullying, about elitism and about a toxic culture within the equestrian world. I am also very sad because I am a passionate advocate of horses as a force for good and I still believe in the vision that I articulated at the time, and that the BEF are now attempting to implement.
"We've ended up where we are today because about 18 months ago I accepted a job as chief executive of the British Equestrian Federation.
"I had a vision and a passion for democratising equestrianism, for growing it, for modernising it and also for putting it on a firm financial footing. I was the unanimous choice of the board and I was forced out by a systematic process of bullying, elitism, intimidation and the review that has come out today has validated that.
"I grew up in south London, I learned to ride by mucking out stables when I was seven or eight years old in exchange for being allowed to sit on a horse and I didn't fit with the prevailing culture in some of those disciplines.
"I have a passionate interest in horses as a force for good. The vision I set out with at the BEF was to try and make that a reality for a much wider range of people and I'd still like to see that happen and I still think it's possible."
A dysfunctional relationship
Following an investigative process that involved the receipt of 108 written contributions and the holding of 43 interviews, the report sheds a light on what it calls a "dysfunctional relationship" between the BEF and its member bodies.
The review was told by contributors that the power-struggle between the BEF and MBs had "been going on for decades" and was "almost a turf war", while the report states that "various sources referred to the atmosphere created by the long-standing conflict between the BEF and the MBs as 'toxic'".
One section of the report details how that certain MBs were "very concerned, even hostile" towards its publication since in their view "equestrianism's 'dirty-washing' should not be made public".
It also highlighted allegations of a "climate of fear" at British Dressage and a "culture of bullying" within British Showjumping, though added that they were not part of the enquiry or its findings in any way.
'Equestrian sport is like a private club'
Salmon was appointed chief executive in 2016, having previously worked as a director at insurance company Royal London.
The report states that while some within the sport viewed that as a "positive move" that "was aiming to bring equestrianism to a wide audience and to engage with more peripheral areas of the sport" and "a refreshing change [to a] snobbish, old boys' club" of a "military culture", others viewed her as "an outsider".
"There's a small cabal of people within the leadership of the Olympic disciplines, and the report draws attention to this, for whom equestrian sport is almost like a private club," Salmon said.
"The review draws attention, for example, within British Dressage to a small elite team, basically a cabal of people who control the sport, and it also draws attention to the fact that the sport is prohibitively expensive for the majority of people who might be interested in taking part. And that's what I mean by elitism.
"So there were people for whom opening up horse sport to a wider audience was actually anathema, because they would rather break up the party."
Salmon also warned that funding for equestrian sports, already reduced since the Rio Games, should be further reassessed if the recommendations of the report are not implemented.
"I think when public money is at stake, and in this case there's about £20m of National Lottery funding at stake, there is a higher standard, there is a duty of care, to spend that money properly," she said.
"In terms of showjumping, dressage and eventing, I think it's key that there is a dramatic improvement in the leadership of those organizations if UK Sport is to continue supporting them. Public money needs to follow public standards of behaviour."
That warning was echoed by the report itself, which stated: "Funding is conditional on appropriate governance and cultural behaviours. In that regard, UK Sport and Sport England are encouraged to remind all MBs that if they try to usurp the authority of the BEF then their funding may be suspended.
"Certain behaviours which manifested themselves at times during the relevant period were not appropriate for a publicly-funded sport."
What do the funding bodies say?
In a joint statement, UK Sport and Sport England said they "welcome" the review and recommendations.
"All sports - and especially those in receipt of public funding - must demonstrate that they are run to the highest standards of governance, led by skilled and diverse boards. Sports that are unable to demonstrate these standards will not receive funding in the future," it read.
"The review is clear that these standards and behaviours have not been met in the past across equestrian sport.
"While we recognise that structural and leadership changes have recently been made, ongoing funding will be dependent on the BEF and its Member Bodies acting to implement the recommendations of this review. We will keep this under close review."

 Julien Epaillard of France wins at Olympia
Epaillard was one of only four of the 36 riders to go clear at the punishing Olympia lay-out
Frenchman Julien Epaillard denied Britain's Scott Brash a second successive victory in the show jumping World Cup at the Olympia Horse Show.
Four riders went clear to set up a jump-off, which Brash briefly led by clocking 37.34 seconds on Ursula XII.
But Epaillard, riding last, took Toupie de la Roque round in 36.91 to win leg eight of the Western European League.
British riders William Whitaker and Laura Renwick finished eighth and 15th respectively after one fault apiece.
Thirteen nationalities were represented among the field of 36, many of whom found the tight angles of the course difficult to negotiate.
Swede Peder Fredricson, on H&M Christian K, was first to go clear - in 68.29 - then clocked 41.34 on the revised jump-off course.
Australia's Edwina Tops-Alexander then followed her 69.94 on Inca Boy van T Vianahof with a 41.05 to top the leaderboard.
But, despite clipping the top pole of the final obstacle, 2016 winner Brash took the lead with just Epaillard left to jump.
The Frenchman made it a clean sweep of clear rounds in the jump-off to take the title.

Oliver Townend finished fifth on Ballaghmor Class (pictured) and second on Cooley SRS at Badminton Horse Trials
Sanctions imposed on British eventer Oliver Townend for overuse of the whip during this year's Badminton Horse Trials were "not high enough", says the British Horse Society (BHS).
Townend, 35, was given an official warning by the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI).
He has since issued two public apologies for his riding on Saturday.
"The behaviour displayed was completely unacceptable," said BHS director of welfare Gemma Stanford.
"The welfare of the horse should always be paramount.
"We strongly believe that the sanctions given to Mr Townend by the FEI were not high enough in this particular case. The British Horse Society will be raising these concerns to the FEI."
On Monday, Townend - the 2009 Badminton winner - admitted replays of his rides on Cooley SRS and Ballaghmor Class during Saturday's cross-country phase "didn't look good".

 Jonelle Price and Classic Moet at the Badminton Horse Trials
Price and Classic Moet jumped from 22nd to top with a fine display in the cross country
Oliver Townend's Grand Slam quest was ended by New Zealand's Jonelle Price, who went clear in the show jumping to triumph at the Badminton Horse Trials.
Townend, Badminton winner in 2009, was seeking the £255,000 prize that goes to a rider who wins consecutive Burghley, Kentucky and Badminton titles.
With Burghley and Kentucky wins already secured, the British rider went clear on Cooley SRS to finish on 33.1 points.
But Price also went clear on Classic Moet and won with a score of 28.
Price, 37, who gave birth to son Otis in August, is the first woman to win the event since Australia's Lucinda Fredericks triumphed aboard Headley Britannia in 2007.
Price began Sunday's final day at the top of the standings after collecting just 0.4 time penalties in Saturday's cross country.
Britain's Rosalind Canter and Allstar B had one down and finished third on 34.3.
Townend also took fifth place with his second ride, Ballaghmor Class, as 11 British pairs finished in the top 20.
The 35-year-old had been issued with an official warning on Saturday regarding his over-use of the whip on both horses.
"If you are at the top of your game, you are always going to get someone try and trample you," said Townend, whose 11-year-old mount Cooley SRS was competing in a four-star event for the first time.
Pippa Funnell in 2003 and Michael Jung in 2016 remain the only winners of the Grand Slam.
Wiltshire-based Price said: "I am sure it will sink in later. It is surreal. It is like joining an elite club.
"I knew it was going to take a clear round to win today, and I was trying not to bother to look at who was having fences down and who wasn't. I just tried to stick to my plan.

 British Equestrian Federation
Three independent panel members will review the culture at the sport under the BEF
The British Equestrian Federation has launched an independent investigation into allegations of bullying, elitism and corruption in the sport.
It comes after the resignation of ex-chief executive Clare Salmon in July.
The BEF oversees 15 member bodies, including those responsible for showjumping, dressage and eventing.
It is the latest governing body to face claims over its sport's culture, after reviews at British Cycling,British Swimming and British Bobsleigh.
A statement from the BEF said the basis for the independent review would be "issues of alleged elitism, self-interest, bullying and corruption".
The investigation will also look at whether there were "fundamental relationship issues within and between the organisations involved in British equestrian sport".
In July, UK Sport told the BBC that it endorsed the BEF's independent investigation.
The review panel will report back to the BEF boards, UK Sport and Sport England in December.

Oliver Townend said reclaiming the Burghley Horse Trials title on Sunday was years in the making.
It was a first four-star event triumph for the Yorkshireman since the last time he prevailed at Burghley in 2009.
Townend, on Irish-bred 10-year-old gelding Ballaghmor Class, led home a British one-two-three.
"Some people say I've been going through a rough patch, but I don't see it that way. I just see it as preparing for the future," he told BBC Sport.
Townend finished on a total score of 45.6 and was followed by Piggy French on 46.9, with Gemma Tattersall third on on 47.0.

Speaking after what is his second win at the Lincolnshire venue, Townend paid tribute to his Irish-bred horse: "I looked around the collecting ring (before the show jumping) and thought to myself 'I wouldn't swap him for anything else here'."
With a 20% increase in prize money for the event - one of just six four-star eventing competitions in the world - victory came with a £90,000 reward.
Second place received £50,000 and third £36,000, with prize money being awarded down to 20th place.

Little wonder then that Leicestershire's Willa Newton had wanted a top-20 place as reward for years of hard work.
While, it was third time lucky for the 27-year-old - she fell on the cross-country in her first year, then failed to pass the trot-up before the vets to get into the third and final show-jumping phase at her last attempt - this year Newton eventually finished in 35th place with her horse Chance Remark with a score of 129.
Speaking after the show jumping, Newton said she tried to put her cross-country disappointment of the previous day behind her and that Chance Remark "felt fresh".
However, she went on to blame herself for the pole down after keeping him on too tight a rein.

"It's always frustrating to have one down, but the rest of the round felt very good and he jumped very well," she said.
Just to get to Burghley is an endurance test of training and preparation, and competing at the lower levels.
It was a particularly challenging year at Burghley, with a number of pre-event favourites failing to complete all three days.
Among the high-profile names not to make it all the way through was New Zealand's five-time Burghley winner Sir Mark Todd.
While Chance Remark is now due a "holiday", Newton is already planning for her next Burghley attempt.
"We'll start to build his training over the winter to be ready for the next season," she said.
"It'll be good to watch the cross country video again to get rid of those mistakes so that we're ready for next year."
Things look likely to stay just as busy for the rider from Melton Mowbray.
"I've got a few good horses coming through so we've got Blenheim in a couple of weeks' time to concentrate on," she said.Burghley Horse Trials: Oliver Townend wins second title

Oliver Townend secured the second Burghley Horse Trials title of his eventing career as British riders enjoyed the final day in Lincolnshire.
The Yorkshireman became a first British winner at Burghley since William Fox-Pitt six years ago as he took 10-year-old Ballaghmor Class to victory.

"It is a tough job, but I have got so much faith in this horse and I am glad he proved me right," the 34-year-old said.

A new tourism scheme hopes to boost equestrian tourism in the Borders.
Ride Scotland's Horse Country aims to develop a network of facilities for riders and their horses along more than 300 miles of off-road trails.
Project co-ordinator Gowan Miller said the region had the "perfect combination" of spectacular countryside and long-established trails.
If successful, it is hoped the scheme could spread out into Northumberland and Dumfries and Galloway.
The Southern Uplands Partnership secured Leader funding for the project and it has now been backed by a range of other bodies.
'Recognised brand'
"The first phase involves identifying high quality accommodation and stopover points for riders and their horses on a trail-by-trail basis," said Ms Miller.
"Our initial target is to get 15 establishments on board and to expand the trails network from there.
"We are currently talking to those with accommodation and equestrian facilities to establish trail-stopovers and would like to hear from anyone interested in diversifying their existing business or those already established that might want to take part."
She said the ultimate aim was to establish a "nationally recognised brand".
"Our initial target audience would live within a two to three-hour drive away from our trails," she said.
"In the longer term we hope to attract horse lovers from throughout the UK and abroad."Mike Tucker: BBC equestrian commentator dies, aged 73

Mike Tucker was BBC's equestrian commentator for 40 years
BBC equestrian commentator and former eventer Mike Tucker has died suddenly at the age of 73.
He retired from broadcasting last year, having worked at six Olympic Games.
Tucker, who lived in Gloucestershire, joined the BBC in 1977 and took over as lead equestrian commentator in 1992.
He voiced famous moments including Zara Tindall's 2006 world title, Britain's successes at London 2012, as well as Charlotte Dujardin and Nick Skelton claiming gold at the 2016 Rio Olympics.
"I've been very privileged and enjoyed some great moments," Tucker said upon his retirement after the 2017 Badminton Horse Trials.
A family statement said: "Mike has been a stalwart of the equestrian, hunting and Cotswold farming community for many years and will be very sadly missed.
"More than that, he was a loving and devoted family man."
The BBC's director of sport Barbara Slater added: "Mike was the voice of equestrian commentary, his words guiding audiences through many wonderful moments in the sport throughout his career.
"He was greatly admired by audiences and those of us at BBC Sport alike. Our thoughts and sympathies are with his family. "
Fellow presenter Lee McKenzie said on Twitter: "Very sad to hear that Mike Tucker is no longer with us. A stalwart of the equestrian world. Taught me so much. Proud to have worked with him and call him a colleague and a friend."
Tucker became the chairman of the organising committee of Olympia two years ago, and in a statement the show's director Simon-Brooks Ward said: "This is a great shock and sadness for all of those involved at Olympia.
"Mike was a friend, provided wise counsel, and was professional to the last."

 Roaring Lion wins at York
Roaring Lion scored for John Gosden, a two-time Derby winner
Roaring Lion is rated about 6-1 second favourite for the Derby next month after winning York's Dante Stakes but is not certain to run at Epsom.
The John Gosden-trained winner (3-1 favourite) - ridden by Oisin Murphy - triumphed by four and a half lengths.
Long-time leader Mildenberger (7-2) was second with Zabriskie (50-1) third.
Roaring Lion was fifth in the 2,000 Guineas and his York win franks the form of Guineas winner and Derby favourite Saxon Warrior.
"He's a playboy. He's inclined not to concentrate sometimes," said Gosden of Roaring Lion, who is owned by Qatar Racing.
Gosden said it was not clear whether the horse would run at Epsom or in the French Derby.
Analysis
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
Roaring Lion looked as though the mile and a half of the Derby at Epsom - a quarter-mile further than this - would be within his range. After all, he certainly wasn't stopping at the end.
However, the mile and a quarter of France's equivalent may be considered more suitable, and there are two other tempting advantages associated with a trip across the Channel.
Saxon Warrior, who has beaten Roaring Lion on the two occasions they've met, won't be there, and the owners affiliate company QIPCO sponsors the French prize.
Racing 'should not be funded on misery'.Racing should not be funded by 'misery' of fixed-odds betting terminals - culture secretary
From the sectionHorse Racing

What are fixed-odds betting terminals?
Culture secretary Matt Hancock says horse racing should not be funded by "misery" as he announced new rules on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs).
The maximum stake on the machines, dubbed the "crack cocaine of gambling" as people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds, will be reduced to £2 under the proposals.
Bookmakers say the move could lead to hundreds of shops closing.
Research has suggested it could cost British racing up to £60m annually.
Bookmakers support horse racing through an industry levy, and by paying for media rights and sponsoring races.
The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) says Hancock has asked officials to investigate the potential of expanding the levy to include global racing bets placed in Britain.
Betting machine stakes cut to £2
Roaring Lion wins Dante Stakes at York
Hancock, the Conservative MP for West Suffolk, told BBC Radio Four's Today programme: "I represent Newmarket, which is the home of horse racing. I love horse racing and there is an interaction between the sport and the gambling industry.
"We are working with the British Horseracing Authority on a package of measures to mitigate the impact on horse racing.
"But I would say this to people in the horse racing industry, and who love that sport: Horse racing should not be financed on the back of this misery."
He added: "Horse racing is a wonderful sport that can, and will, pay for itself and be financially successful without having to ruin the lives of people using these machines.
"Horse racing is glorious. It doesn't have to be based on these machines, which are designed by their algorithms, to ensure people cannot win."
Gambling graphic
The government's consultation into electronic casino games, such as roulette, found consistently high rates of problem gamblers among players of FOBTs.
Hancock said he had spoken to people in his constituency who had lost thousands of pounds and pleaded for changes.
BHA chief executive said British racing had "a strong social conscience" and supported the government measures.
"It is too early to say what the financial impact for racing will be," he said.
"Our estimates before today's decision ranged from £40 to £60 million per year, once the impact of the changes has filtered through into racing.
"These estimates did not take into account the Secretary of State's suggestion that the levy could be extended to bets on global racing, which could partially offset any reduction.
"We are also encouraged by the Secretary of State's reference to a period of transition which will allow time for racing and betting to adjust."
Fred Done, the co-founder of bookmakers Betfred, accused the government of playing politics with people's jobs.
"This decision will result in unintended consequences including direct and indirect job losses, empty shops on the high street, and a massive funding hit for the horse racing industry," he said.

 Harry Angel wins at York
Harry Angel has won five out of nine races - with all his defeats coming at Ascot
Harry Angel will be aimed at Royal Ascot next month after the sprinter returned with a comfortable win at York.
The 4-9 favourite, ridden by Adam Kirby for trainer Clive Cox, beat Brando by two lengths in the Duke of York Stakes.
Bookmakers reacted by cutting the winner's odds for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Ascot to about 3-1 from 4-1.
Give And Take, trained by William Haggas, won the Musidora Stakes under James Doyle.
The race is traditionally a trial for the Oaks, although Haggas said it was not certain the filly would run in the Epsom Classic on 1 June.
Trainer Richard Fahey enjoyed a 857-1 treble with victories for George Bowen, Clubbable and Charming Kid.
Last year's July Cup winner Harry Angel will be seeking a first Ascot win at the Royal meeting - with all four defeats in his nine-race career coming at the Berkshire track.
"People mention he's never won at Ascot but I think they are reading too much into it," said Haggas.
With racecourses in the spotlight after brawls at Goodwood and Ascot, the first day of the Dante meeting passed off without major incident.

Media captionWhat are fixed-odds betting terminals?
The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) will be reduced to £2 under new rules unveiled by the government.
Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette.
Culture Secretary Matt Hancock called the machines "a very serious social blight" that "needs to be tackled".
But bookmakers have warned the cut could lead to thousands of outlets closing.
FOBTs generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government.
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that in order to "cover any negative impact on the public finances" it would increase the Remote Gaming Duty, which is levied against online casino-type games such as blackjack.
The current rate operators must pay is 15% compared with a 25% tax on FOBTs. The government will announce the rise in the Budget.
'Political decision'
William Hill, which generates just over half its retail revenues from FOBTs, described the £2 stake limit as "unprecedented" and warned that 900 of its shops could become loss-making, potentially leading to job losses.
It said its full-year operating profit could fall by between £70m and £100m.

Industry figures argue that what is at stake is not only jobs and revenues for the Exchequer, but the principle that in a free society fully informed adults should be free to spend their money as they choose, so long as it doesn't harm others.

The government's consultation into gambling machines found consistently high rates of problem gamblers among players of FOBTs "and a high proportion of those seeking treatment for gambling addiction identify these machines as their main form of gambling".
Anti-gambling campaigners have condemned the machines, saying they let players lose money too quickly, leading to addiction and social, mental and financial problems.

Matt Zarb-Cousin is now a spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling but was previously addicted to FOBTs.
"It's no exaggeration to call FOBTs the crack cocaine of gambling," he has told the BBC.
"If we had a gambling product classification, similar to that of drugs, FOBTs would be class A."
William Hill chief executive Philip Bowcock, said: "The government has handed us a tough challenge today and it will take some time for the full impact to be understood."
GVC Holdings, which owns Ladbrokes, said it expected profit to be cut by about £160m in the first full year that the £2 limit is in force.
However, Peter Jackson, chief executive at Paddy Power Betfair, welcomed the government intervention, saying his company had been concerned that FOBTs were damaging the reputation of the gambling industry.
The British Horseracing Authority (BHA), which receives millions of pounds from bookmakers through a levy, said it would work closely with the government to respond the decision.
Problem gambling
FOBTs are not the only culprits when it comes to problem gambling.
A survey conducted by social research agency NatCen found the top five activities with the highest proportions of problem gamblers were:
Spread betting, where bets are placed on whether an outcome will be above or below an offered range (20.1%)
Betting exchanges, where your bet on the outcome of an event is matched with someone with the opposing bet (16.2%)
Playing poker in pubs or clubs (15.9%)
Betting on events with a bookmaker, not online (15.5%)
Playing machines in bookmakers, including FOBTs (11.5%)
The most popular types of gambling in the country - National Lottery draws, other lotteries and scratchcards - are associated with the lowest levels of problem gambling.

 Harry Angel wins at York
Harry Angel has won five out of nine races - with all his defeats coming at Ascot
Harry Angel will be aimed at Royal Ascot next month after the sprinter returned with a comfortable win at York.
The 4-9 favourite, ridden by Adam Kirby for trainer Clive Cox, beat Brando by two lengths in the Duke of York Stakes.
Bookmakers reacted by cutting the winner's odds for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Ascot to about 3-1 from 4-1.
Give And Take, trained by William Haggas, won the Musidora Stakes under James Doyle.
The race is traditionally a trial for the Oaks, although Haggas said it was not certain the filly would run in the Epsom Classic on 1 June.
Trainer Richard Fahey enjoyed a 857-1 treble with victories for George Bowen, Clubbable and Charming Kid.
Last year's July Cup winner Harry Angel will be seeking a first Ascot win at the Royal meeting - with all four defeats in his nine-race career coming at the Berkshire track.
"People mention he's never won at Ascot but I think they are reading too much into it," said Haggas.
With racecourses in the spotlight after brawls at Goodwood and Ascot, the first day of the Dante meeting passed off without major incident.

Big Orange out for season
Big Orange, winner of last year's Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, has been ruled out for the season.
The popular seven-year-old was due to bid for consecutive victories in the Henry II Stakes at Sandown later this month.
But trainer Michael Bell said the horse would be sidelined with a leg injury.
"It's a body blow for all concerned but the vet is cautiously optimistic that it should heal in time," he said.
Betting machine stakes cut to £2
17 May 2018

Media captionWhat are fixed-odds betting terminals?
The maximum stake on fixed-odds betting terminals (FOBTs) will be reduced to £2 under new rules unveiled by the government.
Currently, people can bet up to £100 every 20 seconds on electronic casino games such as roulette.
Culture Secretary Matt Hancock called the machines "a very serious social blight" that "needs to be tackled".
But bookmakers have warned the cut could lead to thousands of outlets closing.
FOBTs generate £1.8bn in revenue a year for the betting industry, according to the Gambling Commission, and taxes of £400m for the government.
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that in order to "cover any negative impact on the public finances" it would increase the Remote Gaming Duty, which is levied against online casino-type games such as blackjack.
The current rate operators must pay is 15% compared with a 25% tax on FOBTs. The government will announce the rise in the Budget.
'Political decision'
William Hill, which generates just over half its retail revenues from FOBTs, described the £2 stake limit as "unprecedented" and warned that 900 of its shops could become loss-making, potentially leading to job losses.
It said its full-year operating profit could fall by between £70m and £100m.

 Saxon Warrior wins at Newmarket
Saxon Warrior has won all four of his career starts
Investec Derby
Date: Saturday 2 June Venue: Epsom Time: 16:30 BST Coverage: Commentary on BBC Radio 5 live
British racing's Triple Crown is a target for 2,000 Guineas winner Saxon Warrior, says trainer Aidan O'Brien.
The son of Deep Impact is likely to be one of up to six O'Brien horses to run in the Derby at Epsom on 2 June.
No horse has won the Guineas, Derby and St Leger since Nijinsky in 1970 and O'Brien narrowly missed out on the treble with Camelot six years ago.
"If there's a chance we had a Triple Crown horse, this was always going to be the horse," said the Irish trainer.
"That's why we started him off in the Guineas. We are still alive and kicking after the first round."
2,000 Guineas: Saxon Warrior wins at Newmarket for Aidan O'Brien
Nijinsky was trained by Vincent O'Brien, who is no relation, from the same Ballydoyle training base in Tipperary.
His daughter Sue, the wife of Coolmore breeding supremo John Magnier, is among the owners of Saxon Warrior and Aidan O'Brien indicated the Triple Crown was a "romantic" target.
"We could not have been happier with Saxon because there's an awful lot of improvement to come. It'll be exciting to see," he said.
In the Derby he is also set to saddle Delano Roosevelt and The Pentagon, who finished second and third respectively in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial at Leopardstown on Sunday.
Kew Gardens, runner-up in the Lingfield Derby Trial on Saturday, could also run in the Epsom Classic.
"I'd imagine those four will run and we'll see if anything else goes with them," O'Brien added.
James Cook and Zabriskie, who are set to run in the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday, are other possible contenders for O'Brien.

From the sectionHorse Racing
Share this page
 Ascot
Royal Ascot takes place over five days at the Berkshire course in June
More uniformed security officers may need to be deployed at tracks after outbreaks of violence, say racecourse bosses.
Fighting broke out at Ascot on Saturday, a week after police said around 50 people were involved in "multiple altercations" at Goodwood.
Racecourse Association (RCA) chief executive Stephen Atkin said tracks would need to assess security measures.
"It means employing the right level of security staff," he told BBC 5 live.
"The question you have to consider is how many of those should be in high visibility and how many in plain clothes. That is something racecourses may want to look at and step up the level of visibility."
The British Horseracing Authority (BHA) says troublemakers could be banned from racecourses.
"We have been in contact with the RCA this weekend and we know that courses will take into account the incidents as they make their security plans for each meeting," it said.
"The BHA does have the power to exclude individuals from courses and will use it where it can."
Racing: Saxon Warrior given Triple Crown target
At Ascot, a window was smashed at the course as trouble broke out in a stand and footage was later widely circulated on social media of racegoers trading blows outside the entrance.
Police said two men with minor injuries were treated at the scene and no arrests had been made.
Racecourse officials said security had been increased and the incident was dealt with quickly. They have pledged to put in place "appropriate measures" for Royal Ascot next month, although did not expand on details.
Atkin acknowledged that drugs, as well as alcohol, were an issue at some meetings.
"There is very considerable training which the RCA helps run of racecourse staff about serving alcohol in bars and making drinking water freely available and advising people how to pace themselves," he said.
"With the issue of drugs, there are regular checks on areas that may be prone to drug misuse. The RCA and our racecourse experience group are in regular touch with the police officers' association about how we can best tackle that. "
The BHA indicated after the Goodwood incident that "crowd control and behaviour" could be taken into consideration when a racecourse licence is issued under new plans.
York racecourse believes it has measures in place for this week's Dante meeting to prevent trouble, including the use of sniffer dogs.
"We're obviously aware of the unsavoury incidents and we will take all the sensible precautions to take racegoers' safety where it should be," said James Brennan, York's head of sponsorship and marketing.

Eyewitness
Craig Newman, who filmed the Ascot brawl:
There were 20 or 30 people throwing punches. It was after the races had finished.
You could see moving through the crowd how many people were off their faces, whether it was drink or drugs. You could tell it was going to happen.
There was supposedly plain-clothed security, but there was no visible security I could see. Maybe that is what they need, people with fluorescent jackets.
Analysis
BBC horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
There have, of course, been incidents in the past but not on this kind of scale, with this kind of widespread publicity - the number looking at the frightening images of the Ascot fight online is well into seven figures.
It's as much the talk of the racing community as who'll win next month's Derby at the moment, especially as the two tracks concerned are Ascot and Goodwood, both of which trade on their 'upmarket' reputations.
The word that is used most frequently when discussing this is cocaine. People are talking not so much about drink and other things causing this type of problem, but drugs being the number one factor.
One of the priorities for racecourses this summer - and this is happening - is to bring in sniffer dogs to catch people with drugs; I was struck during a visit to the gents at a recent fixture that there was a queue for the privacy of cubicles when urinals were free, a tell-tale sign I'm told.
More overt security - police officers, with the powers of arrest and the consequences that can follow - is on the cards, and needed, to deter people who wouldn't take any notice of a well-meaning security person in a bowler hat at Ascot or Panama at Goodwood or even a hi-vis jacket.
With Royal Ascot and Glorious Goodwood not far off, and events like the Derby on the horizon, racing officials must have this at the very top of the agenda, to stamp it out quickly before the sport gets a reputation as the go-to place for this type of activity, putting off the law-abiding majority.
Meanwhile, those identified as the culprits should be hit hard and swiftly with bans from all racecourses for life.Knight To Behold takes Lingfield Derby Trial victory

The 7-1 chance Knight To Behold got the better of odds-on favourite Kew Gardens to win the Derby Trial at Lingfield.
Jockey Richard Kingscote took the Harry Dunlop-trained colt to the front early on once the field had settled down.
The pair were well clear entering the straight but Ryan Moore tried to close the gap on the 8-11 favourite Kew Gardens, trained by Aidan O'Brien.
However, Knight to Behold held on well to win by three and a quarter lengths, with Corelli back in third.
"He's a proper horse. He showed a nice attitude," Kingscote said.

Rutten says McGregors meteoric rise to fame and fortune has happened so quickly it can be hard to adjust to the sudden change in his life. Its a situation he says he would have struggled with during his heyday, too.
He did so much good for MMA, he continued.
He just needs to find his way in this world. This guy was pretty much unknown four years ago, now hes one of the most known guys on the planet. Thats a hard thing to deal with. I dont know if I could have done it.
I always try to put myself in their shoes. Me with that kind of money at that age? I dont know what would have happened to me. Im a smart guy now - I would think that I would keep that money. But at 28? I dont know, man. I was just a completely different animal.
I hope they give him a pass, dont spit him out yet. Let him see if he cleans up.

Rutten also spoke about the possibility of McGregor returning to fight for the UFC lightweight title later in the year against newly-crowned world champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.
Its a classic striker versus grappler matchup, with McGregors slick striking contrasting with Russian Nurmagomedovs dominant wrestling and heavy-handed ground and pound. Its a matchup that Rutten says would offer a huge test of the Irishmans all-round MMA skills.
I go back to Chad Mendes (versus McGregor at UFC 189), he said.
Chad had 12 days to train and he put him on his back immediately. And he (McGregor) had a problem off his back.
Khabib is a guy that is not going to run out of gas. Hell have a full training camp, hes gonna be on him. Now, dont get me wrong, Khabibs never been knocked out or nothing, but Conor can hit. He can really hit.
If he really uses footwork he can land his shot and hopefully capitalise on that. But I think once it goes to the ground, a guy like Khabib is just very hard to get off you.
This is not about just hold.
A post shared by Khabib Nurmagomedov (@khabib_nurmagomedov) on Mar 15, 2018 at 12:57am PDT

The general consensus is that McGregor would hold a significant striking advantage while the fight is on the feet, but Nurmagomedov could dominate proceedings with his wrestling if he can close the distance and get his hands on the Dubliner.
And avoiding Nurmagomedovs takedowns is an aspect of McGregors game that Rutten says hell have to work hard to improve ahead of any potential bout with the undefeated Russian.
He knows its his Achilles heel, so he needs to work on that, he said of McGregors wrestling.
I was pretty much the same as Conor. I was great striker, but I sucked at takedown defence. So I dont know, its a hard one.
Its a punchers chance. He uses a lot of footwork and he can tag him and actually knock him out. Conor can do it, but can he knock him out? Thats the question. Otherwise, its gonna be one of those fights.
Hes gonna have to work angles. But 25 minutes of fight time? Its a long time to avoid a takedown.

UFC women's bantamweight champion Amanda 'The Lioness' Nunes continued her reign with a fifth-round stoppage of American Raquel Pennington on Saturday night.
Nunes's victory was her third successive title defence, and her seventh-straight victory, as she underlined her status as one of the most dominant forces in women's MMA.
THE UNDISPUTED CHAMPION OF THE WORLD!

The bout made history as the first world title fight between two openly gay fighters in UFC history. And the two combatants battled it out for five rounds before Nunes eventually claimed the TKO stoppage in front of a home crowd in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
But the finish to the main event at UFC 224 left a sour taste, as Pennington was sent out to continue in the fifth and final round after clearly trying to quit on her stool at the end of the fourth round.

"I'm done," she told her team, who nonetheless talked her into going out for the final round. She was then taken down and finished mid-way through the final round by the dominant world champion.
Many took to Twitter to express their disbelief.
Think about how insanely confident fighters are.
Think about how crazy it can sound when they profess their strengths.
They're the most confident people I've ever met.
For a fighter to say they don't want it anymore is the hardest thing for them to admit.
Listen to them.

That's a tough call for Raquel's corner, honestly. Title fight. How many of those do you get in a career? But I would have thrown the towel the second Nunes took her down in the fifth. No miracle was gonna happen after that.

After the bout, an emotional Nunes admitted that the challenge of fighting Pennington, a longtime friend, was an extremely difficult one.

"I've never fought anybody as a friend. This is the first time ever, she said.
"I respect those girls so much. It was the hardest fight in my career."
"We are friends. We're gonna leave this cage (and) we're gonna have a beer and celebrate our friendship. Tonight was my belt, but the first thing was the respect and the friendship we have."
Gastelum stakes title claim
The 13-fight card in Rio produced a feast of finishes, with only two of the night's bouts going to the scorecards.

One of those decisions came in the night's co-main event, as Kelvin Gastelum squeezed past Ronaldo 'Jacare' Souza after a highly competitive three rounds.
Gastelum effectively nullified Jacare's elite-level submission game by stuffing 10 of the Brazilian's 11 takedown attempts en route to a split-decision victory.

After taking the win with scores of 29-28, 28-29, 29-28, Gastelum thanked the Brazilian crowd in their native tongue before staking his claim for the next shot at the undisputed middleweight world title.
Hopefully Im in line next for that title, he said.
If not, I'm ready for anybody. But I feel like the winner of this fight should fight the winner of Yoel (Romero) and Robert (Whittaker) later on this year, preferably in Madison Square (Garden).
Machida serves up Knockout of the Year contender
One of Lyoto Machida's most memorable moments came back in 2011 when he spectacularly knocked out UFC legend Randy Couture with a Karate Kid-style front kick at UFC 129.
And 'The Dragon' repeated the feat in stunning style as he knocked out fellow former light-heavyweight champion Vitor Belfort at UFC 224.
The knockout came at the 60-second mark in the second round, and afterwards, Machida paid tribute to his opponent.
"I have a lot of respect for Vitor Belfort, he's done a lot for this sport," he said.
"I was looking for the right moment. All I need is one strike to end the fight."
And Machida ended his night by calling out Britain's former UFC middleweight champion.
"Michael Bisping. I'm still waiting for you, man! I want to do this fight. If you're not retired, you've gotta fight me first!"
And with the Rio crowd chanting his name, fellow UFC legend Belfort officially announced his retirement from the UFC as he laid his gloves down inside the octagon and left the cage for the final time.

UFCs Darren Till was born and bred in Liverpool, but when he was 19 he upped and moved to Brazil to focus on his MMA career. After four years of intense training, he returned to the UK. Now, the Welterweight is one of the most talked-about UFC fighters. Ahead of his headline bout at UFC Liverpool on 27 May, the 25-year-old talks about how his move across the world made him the fighter he is today.

He comes with the nickname the 'Nigerian Nightmare' but number seven-ranked UFC welterweight, Kamaru Usman, faced his own bad dream last month when his upcoming bout with Santiago Ponzinibbio was cancelled.
Usman was due to take on the fighter at the UFC's first ever event in Chile, but when the Argentine was forced to withdraw because of injury, a new opponent had to be found. 
Now Usman will face Demian Maia for Sunday's Fight Night event, and despite his new adversary being widely recognised as one of the most skilled jiu-jitsu fighters in the UFC, Usman isn't concerned. 
The BBC MMA Show spoke with Usman ahead of his fight on 20 May, and he seemed unfazed by the late change. 
Its a minor adjustment, Usman said.
INSTAGRAM
If I have a fight, I like to have ample time to work on what I need to do for that fight but Im a mixed martial artist, so I should be able to adapt to each and every person. Its what we work on in our gym. Whether its a big, tall, fat or small fighter, it doesnt matter because opponents do change.
Its taken nearly two years for Usman to get a shot at Maia, having initially called him out in 2016, but hell finally get his chance this Sunday against what he describes as the most dangerous submission specialist in mixed-martial-arts".
I knew I had what it took to get the job done two years ago, which is why I called him out, Usman added.
INSTAGRAM
This is a business trip for me. Ive come here to do a job and thats what Im going to do. I dont care about the distractions along the way. Im just focused and all in.
INSTAGRAM
From the years of me working on my craft, whether it was wrestling in high school or college, I consider myself classically trained to where you keep your mouth closed and do the work. And once you realise your ability, then you can be vocal about it.
Once I get the job done on Saturday, it should be a statement that Im next in line for that title shot.
INSTAGRAM
Tyron Woodley is the current champion of the welterweight division, although he hasnt fought in nearly a year, so a match-up with a fresh contender is due.
I like Woodley, but I have a goal and thats to be the welterweight champion and he has that belt, so I thats the guy that I want.
Usman also isnt ignoring the other talented opponents in his division, which includes Liverpools Darren Till, who will of course take on number-one-ranked welterweight contender Stephen Thompson at UFC Liverpool on 27 May.
INSTAGRAM
Thatll be a great fight, Usman predicts. Darren Tills a big boy but I just feel that Thompson has a little more in his toolbox to get it done, so Ill give Thompson the edge in whatll be an entertaining fight."
The winner of that fight could determine who Usman will face in the future
I believe after this fight, theres only two or three guys that make sense to fight for the title, Usman claims. And one of them will be the winner of Stephen Thompson v Darren Till.

Rose Namajunas stunned the world of MMA with her knockout victory over Polands Joanna Jedrzejczyk at UFC 217 in November.
The build-up to the fight had been dominated by the then-undefeated Jedrzejczyks aggressive trash-talking, with the 14-0 champion portraying herself as the boogeywoman, promising to take her challengers 'soul'.
But throughout the intimidation, the underdog stood firm. She held her composure and let her actions, rather than words, do the talking.
On the night, Thug Rose was unleashed, as she unloaded a devastating flurry of strikes to pull off a huge upset with a stunning first-round KO. It was Namajunas first knockout victory as a professional, in the biggest fight of her career.
Despite her nickname, in her post-fight octagon interview, Namajunas demonstrated a very different personality to that of the typical UFC champion.

Theres so much crap going on in the media and news, I just want to use my gift for martial arts to try and make this world a better place and change the world, she told the crowd.
This belt dont mean nothing, man! Just be a good person!
Namajunas certainly is a talented fighter, with a special ability to get the better of the woman who had been the most dominant female UFC champion since Ronda Rousey.
And she cemented her position as the queen of the strawweight division when she again defeated Jedrzejczyk in a rematch at UFC 223 in April 2018, this time by unanimous decision.

But what is it like to come out on top in not one but two career-defining fights against the formidable Polish fighter?
I think I answered all the questions to be answered, Rose tells the BBC MMA Show.
She did have a weight cut issue the first time, but the plan was to go in there and finish her the second time. I think I could have done a little bit better, but overall Im proud of my performance.
Namajunas says she found the second fight - this time defending the title - much harder to deal with than the first. 
The lead-up to the second fight was stressful, just because rematches are always difficult and it was a totally different build-up, she says.
There wasnt as much negativity surrounding the whole thing, so we were just kind of sitting back waiting for something to go wrong. Its kind of hard to stay hungry so I just had to be on top of that.
INSTAGRAM
The 25-year-old is incredibly low-key for a UFC champion. There are no arrogant claims, there's no hyperbole. She wants to let her skills do the talking and she has a very down-to-earth approach to being at the top of her sport.
Its pretty cool to be called a champion. Throughout my whole life Ive been good at a load of stuff but I never was really the best at anything until now, she says.
She has spoken before about her desire to leave the trash-talk behind and build a new era in the UFC, bringing back honour and respect to mixed martial arts.
Rose gives credit to her relaxed attitude to her partner, Pat Barry  a former UFC heavyweight  who is also one of her coaches.
The way that I am now, is from my experiences and things that I have learned from Pats UFC career. Thats shaped my personality now and the way that I approach my career, so thats had a huge impact on me.

Namajunas says being able to draw on 38-year-old Barrys experience is a huge advantage.
The learning curve, and the things that you have to adapt to on a daily basis in the UFC, is pretty crazy. Its a huge burden for anybody to have. Not just the fighting itself but learning how to deal with the other responsibilities. So to have somebody whos been there and done that its everything.
But does being in a relationship with an MMA legend, who also happens to be your coach, mean there is a danger of too much MMA in Roses life?
Thats something that we talk about daily, and it does get to be a bit much sometimes, so thats why Ive got to make sure I have a healthy balance. Thats why Ive got a garden, she explains.
INSTAGRAM
Thats what I want to do when I finish fighting  build urban farms and learn how to become a farmer, because thats what I wanted to be when I was a little girl.
My dream is to be a farmer myself, but also to provide opportunities to others who dont have the land or the resources, in order to grow food themselves and teach them how to do it.
Gardening and teaching people how to farm seems a long way from Thug Rose, picking apart undefeated champions in the ring.
"Thug Rose comes out when it needs to. Its not a 24/7 type of deal. Its just a personality that I can draw from when I feel like I have to do whatever I need to do in order to survive.
I dont walk around being a bully or trying to prove to everybody how tough I am. I just use it when I need to, she says.
INSTAGRAM
Namajunas accepts she is a different breed of UFC champion.
"Ive always just been kind of a weirdo ever since I was a little girl. Everybody was always my friend but Ive always been a little bit different from everybody else."
Does Rose believe she attracts a certain type of fan who might consider themselves to be weirdos too? Who perhaps didnt fit in when they were younger, and see her as both a champion in the UFC and a champion in life?
I hope so  that would make me feel a lot less lonely in this world, she reveals.
You know, Pats a weirdo himself in some different ways, so that makes me feel great, but if theres other people that can relate to me, then that helps because it makes me feel that Im not the only one.
INSTAGRAM
So with a future in agriculture calling, how long does Rose think she can stay at the top of the UFC for?
I would say, up to five years. I guess it just how long I want to, she says.
There is somebody out there that can challenge me one day and is going to be beat me but my goal is to fight for five more years and retire when Im 30 and see what I can do in the meantime.

It's finally official. Darren Till will take on number-one welterweight contender Stephen 'Wonderboy' Thompson in the main event of UFC Fight Night in Liverpool.
When the Liverpool event was announced on weigh-in day ahead of UFC London two weeks ago, Till stated that Thompson would be his first-choice opponent for his main event bout.
And the UFC has granted him his wish, with the two-time welterweight title challenger signing on the dotted line to face Till in the Brit's own back yard on 27 May at The Echo Arena.
I dont want to beat him over five rounds. I want to knock him out. I want to devastate his life.
Darren Till
Liverpools Till surged to prominence with a stunning first-round stoppage of UFC legend Donald Cowboy Cerrone in Gdansk, Poland last October.
Now the undefeated Brit has the chance to propel himself into championship contention by handing Thompson - who twice took current champion Tyron Woodley the distance in title fights - the third loss of his professional career.
Speaking about the potential matchup during a media session at UFC London, Till said he'd relish the opportunity to prove his striking credentials against the man widely considered to be the best striker in the division - and one of the best in the UFC.
"Hes such a good striker," Till admitted.
"Hes intelligent. Hes not a brawler. Its well thought-out, the process of his fighting. Mines the same.
And the confident Liverpudlian said he plans on putting on a show and finishing the American in decisive fashion.
I know I can outsmart him, he said.
I dont want to beat him over five rounds. I want to knock him out. I want to devastate his life."
Dorsaf Ganouati is a Tunisian female referee with a mission
By Souhail Khmira

 Dorsaf Ganouati (second right) walks out with her fellow officials at a Tunisian Ligue 1 match
Dorsaf Ganouati was the fourth official for the Tunisian top-flight clash between CA Bizertin and AS Gabes
Tunisian Dorsaf Ganouati has her eyes firmly fixed on becoming a referee in a local Ligue 1 match.
Last May the 33-year-old refereed in Ligue 2 and a year later she was the fourth official for the top-flight clash between CA Bizertin and AS Gabes.
Quite a journey already for the PE teacher who only started officiating for 'fun'.
"When I started it wasn't because I specifically wanted to be a referee, I did it for fun," she told BBC Sport.
"And then I noticed that most of the referees were men and that female presence was "ignored".
"At the beginning, there were few international female referees but they hadn't really made a mark in Tunisian stadiums (in men's matches).
"Women were limited to women's matches or youth games. Why does it have to stop there? So I decided to try other categories."
Ganouati is one of three Tunisian women on Fifa's list of international referees and has been on it since 2015.
The only other woman to have been a fourth official in Tunisia's Ligue 1 was Monia Bedoui back in 1997 season for a match between CS Sfaxienand Club Olympique du Transport.
She is well aware of the pressure involved in making the step up from Ligue 2, when she worked with an all-female team of officials.
"There's more pressure because there's a bigger number of fans in the first division. Especially with the big teams who have a bigger fan following," she said.
"The main source of pressure will be from the fans then on the pitch it comes from officials or players."
Dorsaf Ganouati with former match official Monia Bedoui
Monia Bedoui (left) and Dorsaf Ganouati are the only two women to have been fourth officials in Tunisia's Ligue 1
"Fear is present in every game. Even when I'm refereeing in international games outside the country, there are some concerns.
"You're responsible for the teams and you have to be just and fair to everyone.
"I have my reputation as a referee and people are always watching closely, and any mistake can cost dearly.
"But all that fear goes away once the first whistle blows and you get involved in the game"
Ganouati admits in the early days it was not easy to make progress in a sport dominated by men.
"The main obstacle we have is that we don't have the concept of females being part of professional football matches."
"When I was working in the regional league, they were a bit unwelcoming to women, they would often say: "A woman in the regional league? No!"
The challenges she faced simply spurred her on and the attitude towards her and other female referees is improving.
"Quite the opposite, I insist on taking part now and must carry on," she explained.
"It has gotten better. I have refereed many teams in the regional leagues with fewer issues and things are improving when I referee in 3rd and 2nd division games."
She also feels like an equal among her male colleagues and has earned their respect.
"As far as my colleagues go, we're familiar with each other, we're all equal," she insisted.
Dorsaf Ganouati during the Tunisian Ligue 1 match between CA Bizertin and AS Gabes
"There's no difference between male and female referees.
"They might actually be more respectful since I'm a woman but I also impose my self-respect. The same thing goes for players; I'm in charge of keeping everything in order"
While Ganouati was pleased to get a chance to be part of an officiating team at the highest level she was less happy that it only happened on the last day of the season.
"I don't like the idea of bringing in a female referee solely at the end as a way of "polishing the season", she argued.
"I will try and get given games right from the beginning of next season, at least in the 2nd division, that way even if I'm assigned at the end of the season to a top-flight game, it won't really be a big problem."
She also has a philosophical approach to the violence that was a regular problem at Tunisian stadiums last season.
"I don't feel a threat per se. I feel sorry when I see what happens since this is not a beautiful image of Tunisia especially as our league is viewed practically everywhere," she pointed out.
"But I'm just like every other referee, I know when I go to the stadium there could be a positive or a negative outcome, I'm prepared.
"Fans getting onto the pitch is always a possibility but not that likely. The violence doesn't come from players but from certain fans.
Dorsaf Ganouati lines-up with her fellow officials ahead of the Tunisian Ligue 1 match between CA Bizertin and AS Gabes
"It's still unacceptable for a man to hit or try to assault a woman and I'm thankful that idea still exists."
Awwaz Trabelsi, head of the Tunisian National Referees Administration insisted that there will be more opportunities for female officials.
"Women are represented on the national committees, Fifa is encouraging more female participation in football," he added.
"There are many women refereeing games in Germany for example and why not, we could the see the same for Tunisia.
"It's very possible and very soon that we will see a woman as a main referee in a Tunisian League 1 game."
Ganouati believes that Trabelsi's organisation is doing its best for female referees and has been motivated by their backing.
"When I am given a chance I have to prove myself. If I fail they might not give other women the chance, and if I succeed, I will be given other chances and other women will be as well," she told BBC Sport
With more Tunisian women becoming active in sports, she hopes that others will follow in her footsteps.
She believes that having diversity amongst Tunisian referees will be a beneficial factor for the nation's football.
"I'd advise women to take part in refereeing and get more motivated. The more women we have as referees, the better the competition will be."
She is hoping her next major task will be to take charge of games at the Women's Africa Cup of Nations later this year in Ghana.Ghana FA boss Kwesi Nyantakyi returns to face investigation

Ghana Football Association boss Kwesi Nyantakyi faces a presidential investigation
The head of the Ghana Football Association (GFA) Kwesi Nyantakyi arrived back in the country on Wednesday from Morocco to face an investigation ordered by President Nana Akufo-Addo.
Nyantakyi, who is also the first vice-president at the Confederation of African Football and a Fifa Council member, is accused of fraudulently using the president's name.
As soon as he arrived back in Ghana on Wednesday he voluntarily went to the police in order to begin answering questions.
The GFA boss has been caught on video using the name of the president and other senior government officials to induce "potential investors" to part with money.
The association and Nyantakyi had not responded to the allegations by Wednesday.
Football's world governing body says that it "is closely following this matter and gathering additional information. Please understand we cannot comment further at this stage."
The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the Ghanain police has released a statement saying it will be carrying out the investigation into "alleged offences including corruption."
"Any person with relevant information may submit it to the police CID headquarters."
The video was recorded by investigative journalist Anas Aremeyaw Anas and is due to be broadcast on June 6.
"The president after consultations is fully satisfied that a prima facie basis has been established for criminal investigations to be launched into the conduct of the president of the football association," Akufo-Addo's deputy chief of staff Samuel Abu Jinapor said.
Anas reported on alleged corrupt practices among the Ghanaian judiciary in 2015 that led to the suspension and in some cases dismissal of.Champions League: Horoya hold Mamelodi Sundowns

 Khama Billiat
Zimbabwe's Khama Billiat was on target in his last game for Mamelodi Sundowns against Horoya
Horoya of Guinea scored late to earn a 2-2 draw with visiting Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in Group C of the African Champions League.
Tuesday's match was postponed to allow Sundowns to play a friendly against Spain's Barcelona last week.
The result means Horoya are joint top of the group with reigning champions Wydad Casablanca of Morocco on four points each after two rounds.
Sundowns now have two points with pointless Port of Togo bottom.
The Guineans, competing in the group phase for the first time, had to rely on a goal by captain Aboubacar Camara on 83 minutes to salvage a draw.
They were the better team in the first half of a match and should have been ahead by the end of a goalless opening half.
South African champions Sundowns fell behind on 51 minutes when Ghana-born Ocansey Mandela converted a low cross.
After Horoya came close to increasing their lead, the South Africans scored twice within 10 minutes to grab the lead.
Zimbabwean Khama Billiat levelled with a close-range shot on 69 minutes after being set up by Percy Tau.
Billiat was playing his last match for Sundowns before joining a new club, possibly in Azerbaijan, after six years with the Pretoria outfit.
Uruguayan Gaston Sirino put the visitors ahead from the penalty spot with 11 minutes remaining after Horoya goalkeeper Khadim Ndiaye smashed into Billiat.
But just as Sundowns looked like achieving an unlikely victory, Camara nodded a corner past Ghana goalkeeper Brimah Razak to equalise.
The Champions League now resumes after the World Cup in July when Horoya and Wydad meet twice while 2016 champions Sundowns will be looking for six points when they play Port home and away.World Cup 2026: Morocco write to Fifa as US territories permitted to vote

The Moroccan Football Federation has written to Fifa to complain about US territories being allowed to vote to decide the 2026 World Cup hosts.
Morocco are bidding to host the tournament, against a joint proposal from the USA, Mexico and Canada.
Guam, American Samoa, the US Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico are able to vote on 13 June, but Morocco claim that is a conflict of interests.
The 2026 World Cup finals will be the first to feature 48 teams.
The BBC has learned the Moroccan FA first wrote to Fifa on 26 April, explaining that residents of Guam, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands are US citizens while those of American Samoa are US nationals.
It has now asked Fifa to inform the US territories of their inability to vote in order to allow for a fair bidding procedure.

The race to win the 2026 World Cup hosting rights is thought to be close. Very close.
Every vote counts, hence why Morocco want the four Fifa members prevented from having a vote given they are US territories.
The matter shows no sign of being resolved amicably so it may be that the issue isn't settled now until the day of the ballot.Notts County: Shola Ameobi and Alan Smith leave League Two club

Brighton have completed the signing of Nigeria international defender Leon Balogun on a free transfer.
The 29-year-old left Bundesliga side Mainz at the end of the season and has signed a two-deal with the Seagulls.
Balogun missed the 2014 World Cup through injury but has been named in Nigeria's preliminary 30-man squad for this year's tournament in Russia.
"Leon will add more depth to our defensive options," said Brighton manager Chris Hughton.
"I am pleased to get our first piece of business done so early in the summer. He is in the peak years of his career and I am sure he will integrate well into the squad.
"He also has valuable experience, having played in the Bundesliga, the Europa League and at international level."

 Demba Ba
Demba Ba's last appearance for Senegal was in a friendly against Ghana in 2015
Demba Ba says he is not too disappointed about his omission from Senegal's squad for next month's World Cup in Russia.
Ba, 32, has not played for his country since March 2015 but his recent performances with Turkish side Goztepe led to Aliou Cisse refusing to rule out a recall last month.
Despite Cisse's comments Ba was not named in the 23-man squad for Russia.
"I'm not too disappointed at all," he told Senegalese publication Record.
"I have no control over the coach's decision, I will only hurt myself by pulling my hair out or by feeling sorry for myself.
"The only power I have, in reality, is to keep producing good performances. I do not have to whine about missing the chance to play in a World Cup.
"I have no regrets as my progress in football has taken the proper route because hard work has taken me to where I am today."
After scoring seven goals in 13 appearances since joining the Turkish side in January the local fans and media expected Cisse to give Ba a chance.
After learning of his omission the striker took to social media to throw his support behind the squad.
"Make us proud," he wrote on Instagram under the squad list.
The former Newcastle and Chelsea star also took a philosophical look at his career after he suffered a potentially career-ending broken leg while playing in the Chinese Super League two years ago.
He added: "After 18 months out with injury. In July 2016, people were wondering if my career was over? Today, they are sad because Demba is not on the list of 23 Lions.
Senegal coach Aliou Cisse
Senegal coach Aliou Cisse did not include striker Demba Ba in his World Cup squad
"You can not imagine the path I've taken to get to this stage of my career. I can only feel a sense of pride and contentment.
Injuries prevented Ba from being a regular for the Teranga Lions and he did not feature as they sealed qualification for a second appearance at the World Cup.
Despite his last appearance for Senegal coming under Cisse, against Ghana in a friendly on 28 March 2015, Ba was under no illusions about the task he faced in his quest for a recall.
The likes of Mame Biram Diouf, Moussa Sow, Diafra Sakho, Mbaye Niang and Ismaila Sarr - all World Cup bound - were always ahead of him in Cisse's thinking.
Ba was not the only big name player to miss out with Everton striker Oumar Niasse, Pape Souare, Younousse Sankhare and Armand Traore also failing to make Cisse's final 23.
At their first and only World Cup appearance in 2002, Senegal - led by then captain and now coach Cisse - reached the quarter-finals and beat a star-studded French side in the group stages.
This time around, Senegal will have to get past Poland, Colombia and Japan in Group H of the tournament in Russia.
The Teranga Lions will begin their World Cup Group H campaign against Poland on 19 June in Moscow before they play Japan on 24 June and then Colombia four days later.Famara Diedhiou: Bristol City striker banned for six matches for spitting

Bristol City striker Famara Diedhiou has been banned for six matches after being found guilty of spitting at an opponent.
The incident happened in the 52nd minute of their Championship match against Birmingham City on 10 April.
Diedhiou, 25, had denied the charge but was found guilty by an FA Regulatory Commission after a hearing.
Bristol City said it was "extremely disappointed" with the decision and did not rule out an appeal.
A club statement added: "Bristol City has requested the full written reasons from The FA and upon receipt will consult with the club's legal team as to the options for appealing the decision of the Regulatory Commission."
The ban is exactly the same as that given to Leeds forward Samu Saiz, after he was sent off for spitting against Newport County in the FA Cup in January.
Diedhou is City's record signing, costing £5.3m when he signed from French top-flight club Angers in the summer of 2017.He scored 14 goals in 36 matches in all competitions in his first season at Ashton Gate, but will now miss the first six matches of the 2018-19 season.Liberia to vote against Morocco's 2026 World Cup bid

This is Morocco's fifth attempt to host the World Cup after bids for the 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010 finals
Liberia's FA (LFA) is to break ranks with Africa and vote against Morocco when the decision on who will host the 2026 World Cup is held next month.
The North Africans are taking on a triple North American bid from Canada, Mexico and the United Sates.
In a statement, LFA president Musa Bility said the decision came after talks with President and former World Footballer of the Year George Weah and the Government of Liberia.
The vote will take place on 13 June.
It will be held in the Russian capital Moscow, with more than 200 of Fifa's member associations deciding who will host the first 48-team World Cup.
"Bility said the long-running traditional relationship between Liberia and the United States, the many Liberians living in the US and the impact the World Cup will have on them were key in its endorsement decision," the statement added.
It also highlighted the "commercial value" of the triple bid.
Bility is a member of the Confederation of African Football's Executive Committee.
Morocco, who are bidding to host the World Cup for a fifth time, want to become only the second African nation to stage the finals - after the 2010 finals took place in South Africa.

Zimbabwe international striker Knowledge Musona says he is excited about the 'new challenge' after sealing a move to Belgian giants Anderlecht.
Musona, 27, signed a four-year deal with Anderlecht from rivals KV Oostende, where he spent three years.
"It's another journey, a new challenge that I'm ready for," said Musona.
"I would like to thank Oostende for everything, it was a great experience to be a part of the team."

One of these players is unlikely to be in Ballon d'Or contention - but could be pivotal in the final
The Champions League final will be contested by the highest-scoring teams in this season's competition, with two of the world's most potent forwards on display.
Real Madrid are chasing a record 13th title - and their third in a row - while Liverpool can move above Bayern Munich and Barcelona into third (behind AC Milan) in the list of most European Cup/Champions League wins if they are victorious in Kiev.
The fixture has all the makings of a classic, but what can we learn from the stats heading into the match?
Is Milner the unlikely key man in Kiev?
Why James Milner is Liverpool's Champions League unsung hero
With more than 90 goals between them in all competitions this season, it is hardly surprising the Champions League final has been billed as a battle between Real Madrid's Cristiano Ronaldo and Liverpool's Mohamed Salah.
Both are sure to be in the running for the Ballon d'Or at the end of 2018, but it is a man who is unlikely to receive any individual accolades who could hold the key to success in Kiev.
James Milner made headlines in the semi-final against Roma when he took his tally of assists in this season's competition to eight, equalling the tournament record set by Neymar in 2016-17.Champions League final: Liverpool fans' anger after Kiev flights cancelled

Liverpool fans have spoken of their anger after their flights to the Champions League final were cancelled.
Operator Worldchoice Sports said it could not secure landing slots at Kiev's Boryspil Airport for three planes but it said it had secured an extra last-minute three-night trip.
Disappointed supporters had paid up to £2,000 to get to Ukraine.
Fan Chris Bolland said he was "disgusted" over the fiasco which means he now cannot get to the match.
Liverpool play Real Madrid on Saturday in the Ukrainian capital in their first Champions League final in 11 years.
The Merseyside club said up to 1,000 fans had been affected by the flights problems.

Chris Bolland, who has supported Liverpool for 50 years, paid £2,000 to Worldchoice for a flight and ticket.
But his flight has been cancelled and he will now have to watch the game at home on the TV.
He told the BBC: "I am gutted, to say the least. I am absolutely disgusted and there is nothing I can do about it.
"I will now have to watch it with my dear wife - but that's not a problem as she's a big Liverpool fan as well."
Ironically Mr Bolland had been in Poland, which shares a border with Ukraine, on a business trip and to came home to catch his flight.

The owner of Worldchoice Sports said he was "devastated" to have to cancel flights but vowed to keep trying to help stranded supporters.
Shay Soni blamed the airport authorities in Ukraine for the mess and confirmed all fans will be fully refunded.
"The past 24 hours have been an absolute nightmare. It really has been a very difficult time," he said.
"The issue started last Friday when the slot co-ordinators at Kiev airport were unable to give us slots for our aircraft."
He said they had gone through "almost every avenue" without success until the mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, stepped in and one flight was reinstated.
Mr Soni said the company would keep working to get the remaining flights reinstated but added: "I'm not very hopeful.
"I'm a Liverpool fan. I am really, really upset and sad... We have never had an issue like this before."

Rob Andrews had his Liverpool-Kiev flight cancelled but has now managed to secure a flight from Dublin.
He will fly back to Dublin via Istanbul.
He told the BBC: "I don't even want to work out how much it's costing me. We got very little information from Worldchoice."
On Thursday, Mr Anderson said he had negotiated an agreement with Kiev mayor Vitali Klitschko - a former world heavyweight boxing champion - in a round of phone calls.
In a series of tweets on Friday, Liverpool's mayor said he was chasing an "urgent update" from Worldchoice on "why we have a shambles regarding fans flights, after the concessions made by airport yesterday. Will keep searching for solutions until none left".
He revealed he and Mayor Klitschko were exploring the possibility of another airport nearby being used.

"To every Liverpool fan who is having a nightmare, and I use the word nightmare deliberately, arranging travel to Kiev I can only apologise.
"What should be one of the most exciting times of your lives is currently anything but and that, to me, is inexcusable."
Fans who have secured a means of making the final have complained of the complicated route they are having to take.
Ivan Mulla, 46, from Liverpool, said: "It's been a nightmare, I'm flying from Leeds to Rome then from Rome to Kiev.
"The return is from Kiev to Ankara and then Ankara to Antalya then Antalya to Leeds."

 Match of the Day
Everyone is expecting more explosive attacking play from Liverpool in the Champions League final, but what we don't know is how Real Madrid will try to deal with it.
Reds manager Jurgen Klopp is not going to change his team's style of play or his 4-3-3 formation for Saturday's game, and injuries mean he does not have many options in terms of different personnel either.
In contrast, Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane has some big decisions to make about who to pick in Kiev and what shape to play, but he will make them with the way Liverpool are set up in mind.
Zidane has had moments this season where his side have struggled but, especially in Europe, he has turned it around.
He has got Real to the final not by concentrating on one system to play with but by focusing, round-by-round, on the opposition's set-up instead and each time finding a way to nullify their strengths.
By doing that, and changing Real's formation depending on who they are playing, he has shown he is not a coach who just sends his team out there and tells them to do what they do, despite the brilliant individuals in his squad.
Likely Liverpool XI against Real Madrid in the Champions League final: Loris Karius, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Andrew Robertson, Virgil van Dijk, Dejan Lovren, Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Georginio Wijnaldum, Sadio Mane, Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino
The Liverpool team that began the second leg of their semi-final against Roma is expected to start in Kiev
Real have to outnumber Liverpool's lightning front three
One of the pivotal battles will be down Liverpool's right flank, where Mohamed Salah will be up against Real's Brazilian defender Marcelo, who is the most attacking full-back in world football.
Marcelo creates so much for Real, but getting the best out of him without leaving his side exposed will play a big part in how Zidane decides to structure his whole team.
He has been cautious before against sides who try to play counter-attacking football like Liverpool - and he could repeat that approach.
Zidane might be thinking that if Marcelo is going to get forward, he can give his side some added protection by playing with an extra holding midfielder like Mateo Kovacic as well as Casemiro in a 4-4-2 - like he did in the second leg of their victory over Paris St-Germain in the last 16.
They would sit tight and allow Real to really go for it out wide, but the downside of that for Zidane is it means he potentially does not have room for Toni Kroos or Luka Modric in his team.John Toshack: 'My heart tells me Liverpool but my head says Madrid'

John Toshack says he is hoping Liverpool will lift the Champions League title on Saturday despite thinking Real Madrid will win in Kiev.

"With the players on show it has every opportunity to be a classic.

"But very often in these games when it starts the nerves get the better of you and you start off not wanting to make mistakes.

 Lawro's predictions
BBC Radio 5 live's coverage of the Champions League final starts at midday on Saturday, with kick-off at 19:45 BST. Mark Lawrenson is part of their commentary team in Kiev.
I had never been as nervous before a game as I was before my first European Cup final in 1984. Most of the Liverpool team felt the same way.
We had come all that way through the competition and the entire city was in a kind of frenzy.
You are aware that a lot of the country is behind you too, apart from Manchester United and Everton fans of course.
I was 26 and was not short of big-game experience, but that weight of expectation made it feel different from every other match I had played in before - and I expect it will be the same for the majority of Jurgen Klopp's squad too.
As I am sure they are finding, it was not the hour or two before the game that was the problem, it was in the days beforehand.

The Liverpool team at Stadio Olimpico before the 1984 European Cup final - "once I was out on the pitch, I felt fine," said Lawrenson (third from right, top row)
Preparing for a game like this is the worst time to feel nerves, and the pressure. It is relentless - you cannot escape it anywhere you go.
Even when we were on the plane to go to Rome for the 1984 final, there were fans on board going 'good luck boys, we're going to win' and all that kind of thing.
We were obviously very polite about it but we would kind of look at them and think 'how do you know we are going to win? If you do, I'd like to know how we will do it'.
Psychology just as important as tactics for Klopp
Real Madrid experience important, but it's not everything - Klopp
The week before the final lasts a long time. Once you get into what I called 'game-mode' on the day of the match, however, things change.
There are still nerves, obviously. The 1984 final was the biggest night of my career and it definitely felt like it, especially with the final being at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome and Roma playing at their own ground.
That increased the tension, but there are ways of dealing with it.
Before kick-off, I remember our manager Joe Fagan saying to us 'don't forget this lot are at home. Imagine the pressure that we would be under if we were at home at Anfield in a final'.
He turned it around completely, to make us feel positive about the task that was in front of us.
That was where Joe and the rest of the Anfield bootroom boys - as the Reds' coaching staff was known - were very clever.
We did not call it psychology in those days, it was plain man-management, and it was about getting the best out of the players in the really big games, to make sure we performed in them like we had done during the rest of the season.
Klopp will be trying to do the same ahead of this weekend. His task is to get the team ticking the same way they do when they play extremely well.
'Forget the hype and the millions watching on TV'
Inside the Champions League final stadium in Kiev
Klopp knows Liverpool need to start by flying out of the traps and forget they are playing Real Madrid and all their superstars.
He will be saying to his players that if they treat it like just another game, and they play anything like they know they can do, then they have got a really good chance.
The best way of doing that, from a player's point of view, is to really try to forget about the build-up, the crowd and the millions watching on TV, and play the game, not the occasion or the opposition.
It is difficult but what I would do is kind of transport myself to the old park pitch I played on in Preston as a kid, where the rules are the same and the pitch is the same size - admittedly it might not be the same condition, though.
Normally, no matter what the occasion was, once the match started and I made my first pass or first tackle, it became just another game.
'No great team plays champagne football in every final they win'
Real Madrid have won the Champions League three times in the past four seasons
Real Madrid celebrate in Cardiff last year - they have won the Champions League three times in the past four seasons. Not one player to have played for Liverpool this season has appeared in a Champions League final, while eight of the Real squad are in line to win the trophy for a fourth time
It is even more important that Liverpool get to grips with the occasion because it is new to them, compared to Real, who are going for their third Champions League triumph in a row.
Both teams have got players with outstanding individual ability and they are both devastating when they go forward.
As well as their glittering histories in European football, they both play in a way that neutrals enjoy watching. That is rare for a game like this, and it will be something to savour - although not by the Liverpool players.
The biggest difference between the sides is in the extra experience that this Real team have got. Once they get in front in these big games, they know how to close them out, while Liverpool have not shown they can do that yet.
If Real score first in Kiev then they will do absolutely anything to stop Liverpool building up any kind of rhythm.
I don't feel Zinedine Zidane's side will have to play well to beat them, either. They are serial winners for a reason, and no great team plays champagne football in every final they win. The successful Liverpool side that I was a part of in the 1980s certainly didn't.

Lawro's prediction: Liverpool to win 2-1 AET
Real are definitely favourites but I still think Liverpool will find a way to come out on top.
That is basically what they have done to get to the final, as well as score a vast number of goals.
From the quarter-final against Manchester City onwards, it has seemed like there is someone up there looking after them, because of the amount of big decisions that were wrong and went in their favour.
I have been on cup runs where something similar has happened and it gave us a huge amount of belief.
Liverpool's Mo Salah scores in the Champions League semi final against Roma
Liverpool have scored 40 goals in 12 Champions League matches this season. Mohamed Salah (10), Roberto Firmino (10) and Sadio Mane (9) have scored 29 of them
If I was in that Liverpool team, and I was looking back at some of those moments against Manchester City and Roma, I would be thinking 'well we are going to win it, because everything is going for us'.
If I am right, and they do win it for a sixth time, then it would be a huge achievement. It would not just be a first trophy for Klopp at Liverpool, it would be THE trophy.
In that scenario, then in some ways what happens next does not matter, because you can just look at winning the Champions League in isolation. It is that big.
But clearly you would want to see Klopp kick on and challenge for the Premier League title next season, so getting around £100m in prize money will probably help, although they will probably not be far short of collecting that even if they lose.
Premier League snapshot - top of the table: Man City 1st, Man Utd 2nd, Tottenham 3rd, Liverpool in 4th, Chelsea in 5th and Arsenal 6th
Liverpool have not won the league title since 1990 and have finished fourth in each of Jurgen Klopp's two full seasons in charge.
Being European champions would certainly help attract players too, although I think Klopp is a manager any player would want to play for anyhow, just because of the way his teams play.
As a person he is a massive pull too - correct me if I am wrong, but most people like him, don't they?

 Fabian Delph
Delph's last England appearance came in 2015
For most players, football is all that matters heading into a World Cup.But for midfielder Fabian Delph, 28, it could throw up a major dilemma - his wife Natalie is due to give birth to the couple's third child on 30 June.
That's just two days before a prospective last-16 fixture should the Three Lions top Group G in Russia.
But what if he's in the middle of a match when the call comes?
"She's tough, she's a Yorkshire lass so she'll deal with it," joked Bradford-born Delph, who won the Premier League with Manchester City this season.
Delph has already discussed the matter with England manager Gareth Southgate, and will try to fly home to be at the birth if possible - even if that means missing a game.
"We're not 100% certain, with a game on the 28th there might be an opportunity to fly back and then get back fast," he said.
"Gareth has been fantastic. There's nothing more important than family to me - family always comes first and always will."
Fabian Delph lifts Premier League trophy
Delph (holding trophy) won the Premier League title with Manchester City last season
Delph - who previously played for Leeds and Aston Villa before moving to the Etihad in 2015 - last played for England three years ago.
But his performances under Pep Guardiola during City's title-winning season have earned him a recall into Southgate's 23-man squad, despite playing out of position for much of the campaign at left-back in place of the injured Benjamin Mendy.
And while Delph would prefer to play in his natural position of midfield, he's happy to go wherever the team needs him.
"I'm a team player and I think the manager [Guardiola] values people like me, who pretty much put themselves last and put the team first," he said.
"I played left-back as a young kid, but not many times and I played there probably one or two times under Gerard Houllier at Aston Villa.
"But wherever I'm asked to play, I'm all about the team. I've been that way since I was a really young guy, and I'll continue to be that way throughout the rest of my career."

England were soundly beaten by Australia, Scotland and Wales had their best overseas results, and Northern Ireland matched their medal total of four years ago - but what is the reality behind the Commonwealth Games numbers?
Including the Isle of Man's sole silver, the home nations won 229 medals between them. However, hosts Australia accumulated 198, just 31 fewer, all by themselves on the Gold Coast.

Underperforming England?
England leave Australia with a haul of 136 medals but it was a mixed Games for some well-known faces.
According to data analysts Gracenote Sports, Gold Coast 2018 was England's second-worst performance in the 21 editions of the Commonwealths. They won 16.2% of the medals available, only delivering a lower percentage at Melbourne 2006 (15%) - which was also staged in the northern hemisphere spring.
"These championships come very early in the season for athletics," American eight-time world champion Michael Johnson told BBC Sport.
"Most athletes aren't used to running multiple rounds in April."
Sprinter Adam Gemili, who withdrew from the men's 100m final with injury, said: "We all knew it was going to be in April and had plenty of time to prepare for that. It shouldn't be an excuse."
The Gold Coast Bulletin
Australia's media have been unforgiving, with one outlet calling England's performance "woeful"
What do the stats say?: 16.2% of all medals won at the Games were by England, down from the 21% share of medals they claimed at Glasgow 2014.
Winners: Diver Jack Laugher and gymnast Nile Wilson both leave with three golds, while there was a stunning gold for the netball team on the final day. On the athletics track, England's sprint relay teams won double gold.
Disappointments: Double Olympic champion Max Whitlock was tipped to be one of the stars on the Gold Coast, but had to settle for silver on the pommel horse and missed out on a medal on the floor. Swimmer Adam Peaty was beaten in the 50m breaststroke final and Alastair and Jonny Brownlee finished off the podium in the men's triathlon.
What they said
BBC commentator and 1983 world 1500m champion Steve Cram
"As a direct historical comparison, without the Para-sport events that have been added at recent Games, it is the worst Commonwealth Games performance of any England team in track and field.
"You have to take note of that."
Sarah Winckless, chef de mission for England, on the criticism the team has faced
"There's never a nailed-on gold in sport. Commonwealth medals are incredibly hard to get.
"I think 'woeful' would be very, very unkind - and, in fact, unnecessary - for the amazing performances that we have had. For us, we've got really close to our best ever away performance - we didn't quite achieve it."

Katie Archibald wins women's 3,000m individual pursuit
"You sometimes feel embarrassed about over-egging the pride of wearing the Scotland jersey, but this meant so much."
That was cyclist Katie Archibald's reaction when she claimed individual pursuit gold in what would prove to be Scotland's most successful away Commonwealth Games.
They won 44 medals on the Gold Coast - 14 more than the team's pre-Games target and only nine fewer than four years ago at home in Glasgow.
What do the stats say?: Outside the Commonwealth Games, which Scotland have hosted, Gold Coast 2018 was the country's best since 1982 in terms of the 5.2% share of medals won, according to Gracenote.
Winners: Duncan Scott, Scotland's closing ceremony flagbearer, won six swimming medals, including a stunning 100m freestyle gold, while Grace Reid became the first Scottish diver to win Commonwealth gold. Alex Marshall is now the country's most successful Commonwealth competitor after a fifth gold. Para-cyclist Neil Fachie and pilot Matt Rotherham won double gold at the velodrome.
Disappointments: Lynsey Sharp failed to qualify from the 800m heats despite winning silver four years ago in Glasgow.

"When you look at these Games, the fact we've had medals across so many sports and medals coming in every day has been absolutely fantastic.
"It's our best ever overseas games, we're very, very happy. We can't affect what other people do. All I can say is every athlete was fully committed, passionate and left nothing on the table when they were competing for Scotland."

There were five medals in the shooting, while Gareth Evans won gold in the men's -69kg weightlifting and teenage gymnast Latalia Bevan was a surprise silver medallist on the floor.
And while she did not win a medal, 11-year-old Anna Hursey more than impressed in the table tennis, helping Wales to the quarter-finals of the team event.
What do the stats say?: Gold Coast 2018 was the best Commonwealth Games for Wales with a 4.1% share of medals, beating Edinburgh 1986 and Auckland 1990 (both 4.0%).
Winners: Cyclist Elinor Barker produced a stunning performance to win points race gold, Hollie Arnold set a world record with her final throw to claim the F46 javelin title and Sammy Lee and Lauren Price won boxing golds.
Disappointments: Former world 400m hurdles champion Dai Greene was forced to withdraw because of injury, while swimmer Jazz Carlin failed to defend her 800m freestyle title from Glasgow, finishing sixth in the final.

Northern Ireland equal Glasgow haul
Commonwealth Games: Northern Ireland's McClenaghan beats Whitlock to pommel horse gold
Northern Ireland matched their total of 12 medals from Glasgow four years ago with the sole gold coming from 18-year-old gymnast Rhys McClenaghan, who beat Olympic champion Whitlock to win the pommel title - his nation's first Commonwealth medal in artistic gymnastics.
Eight of the medals came in the boxing ring, while sprinter Leon Reid won 200m bronze and Kirsty Barr and Gareth McAuley won trap silver and skeet bronze respectively on the shooting range.
What do the stats say?: Northern Ireland's performance at the 2018 Commonwealth Games was slightly down on 2010 and 2014, but 2018 was one of the country's top three performances in the competition since 1994.
Winners: McClenaghan's gymnastics gold was the defining moment of the Games for Northern Ireland.
Disappointments: Despite winning eight medals, Northern Ireland's boxers may well feel there should have been some golds among them. Michaela Walsh thought she had beaten Skye Nicolson in the featherweight final, but three of the five judges scored the bout in favour of the Australian.
What they said
Gymnast Rhys McClenaghan
"There is a lot more to come from Northern Ireland and after these Games, I think we'll have a big spike in terms of participation and also performance level of athletes."

Homophobia is massive in sport - Daley
The 2018 Commonwealth Games will be remembered for many moments of drama, but arguably its most important legacy will be in helping to bring about a shift in the way sport sees its role in wider society.
It is often said sport and politics should never really mix.
Recent examples include Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson's incendiary comparison between this summer's World Cup in Russia, and the 1936 Berlin Olympics in Nazi Germany. Extreme, yes, but it was also a stark reminder of the controversy whenever politics is accused of exploiting sport.
ADVERTISEMENT
Because, despite such global events being so inescapably political, sport invariably tries its best to pretend the two worlds are somehow kept separate.
Just look at some of the rhetoric used in recent weeks.
Former England footballer Sol Campbell - now a Fifa ambassador - visited Volgograd, one of World Cup 2018's host cities, and was asked about Britain's diplomatic boycott of the event after Russia's alleged involvement in the poisoning of former spy Sergei Skripal. Campbell replied that sport and politics were "almost different galaxies".
Many believe Qatar's hosting of the next World Cup in 2022 is just as political as Vladimir Putin's in Russia.
There is talk Qatar might come under pressure to share the tournament given the current diplomatic crisis with its neighbours.
But tournament chief Hassan Al-Thawadi's response? That the World Cup would never be used as a political tool. "We believe in separating politics from sports, and elevating sports from politics," he told AP.
What of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's yellow ribbon on the touchline in support of imprisoned politicians in Catalonia? "We don't want political symbols in football," said Football Association chief executive Martin Glenn.
On and on. And this sentiment is mirrored in US sport.
"Our playing field is not the place for political statements," said Houston Texans owner Bob McNair when asked about NFL players' kneeling anthem protests.
So, when set against such a backdrop, this year's Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast will perhaps be remembered as groundbreaking.
Because rather than shy away from the political issues that have inevitably arisen during the two weeks of competition, organisers have embraced them.

Follow: Live coverage of the Commonwealth Games final day
Before the action got under way, Commonwealth Games Federation chief David Grevemberg told me of his hope that the event would provide a "fantastic opportunity to magnify awareness of a host of issues, to take advocacy positions, and connect athletes and sports with the social change agenda; from human rights, LGBT rights, and climate change, to female empowerment and indigenous reconciliation".
"This is a watershed moment for all of these causes and the Commonwealth is so well positioned because of the complexity of its shared history, its idealism and some of the challenges and opportunities that it faces right now," he said.
"We absolutely want to be trailblazers for a new movement in sports.
"We're starting to see a number of these things play out in terms of athletes' commitments to different causes."
British diving champion Tom Daley showed precisely what Grevemberg meant. His challenge to the 37 competing nations that still criminalise homosexuality made headlines around the world.
Daley's comments apply a degree of pressure to the Games authorities. After all, all potential host cities are obliged to uphold the UN's guiding principles on human rights, taking meaningful action to ensure equality and inclusivity.
So does this mean that a potential host for the 2026 Games, Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia for instance, where homosexuality is banned, would not currently be considered? Rather than shy away from such a contentious issue, as some sports administrators might, Grevemberg welcomes the debate.
"The CGF will not prevent cities from bidding," he told me.
"Rather, as part of the bid process, we will work with them to look at their local context and laws, and consider how they promote, protect and respect human rights.
"By way of example, Samoa and the Bahamas, hosts of the last two Commonwealth Youth Games, did not have child safeguarding standards in place. We worked with Unicef to instigate change; and as a result, both changed their policy and national legislation to address safeguarding in major events."
There have been other examples of the Games' relevance when it comes to social impact these past two weeks.
From organisers encouraging the Rwandan women's beach volleyball team to wear black armbands to mark the 24th anniversary of the Tutsi genocide, to the prominent celebration of Australia's indigenous culture in the opening ceremony. This was met with opposition in some quarters, but was a deliberate attempt not to swerve the race issues that Australian society continues to wrestle with.
Commonwealth Games: Gold Coast 2018 opens with glittering show
From the Federation's support of New Zealand's controversial transgender weightlifter Laurel Hubbard - despite opposition from some of her rivals - to Gold Coast 2018's status as the first multi-discipline sports event ever to award an equal number of medals to men and women.
As prominent Australian journalist Tracey Holmes noted, the Games has represented "a determined effort to take sport out of its self-imposed quarantine". The Federation, she remarked, was that rarest of breeds - "a sports body that embraces politics".
"Some have said we have been too political with our strong stance towards equality and inclusivity," acknowledges Grevemberg.
"But it's not about politics, it is about humanity. That is what we, Commonwealth sport, are about."
These are important messages for the Games' leaders to get across of course, at a time when they are having to justify themselves, their relevance, their legacy, and their cost. A few months after just two cities - both British - bid for the 2022 Games.
Amid the ongoing concern about a lack of funding for British basketball, it has been announced £70m will be spent upgrading the Alexander Stadium for Birmingham 2022, an event set to cost more than £750m, but which organisers say will be transformational for the West Midlands.
Gold Coast 2018 was not perfect; Games bosses have questions to answer over the delay in getting help to the stricken Scottish runner Callum Hawkins in the marathon. Melissa Lowther was critical of them too for punishing her instead of Team England over the administrative debacle that cost her a place in the cycling time trial. And the organising committee apologised after broadcasters were unable to show athletes entering the stadium for the closing ceremony.
But the Commonwealth Games Federation insists the past two weeks have allowed this symbol of Britain's colonial past to assert a much-needed new identity - sport with a social conscience. And that positive discussions have already begun with potential hosts for the 2026 and 2030 Games. Those who stage the Games, it says, will now be investing in a brand that aims to leave a lasting impact on the community in some way.
Indeed, BBC Sport understands even the International Olympic Committee - having traditionally seen the Commonwealth Games as something of an irrelevance - has been in touch with officials, indicating it could learn from the Federation's social programme as it seeks to improve its image amid continuing fall-out from the Russian doping crisis.
The debate around whether such events are really worth what they cost is set to continue, but at least Gold Coast 2018 has shown in a way rarely seen before, that sport need not be so afraid of the outside world.
And at a time when sports bodies are having to repair their reputations after a series of scandals and controversies, that could be just as important a legacy as the medals that have been won.Commonwealth Games: 'Netball has been shaken; we have a new world order'

England stun Australia to win netball gold with last-gasp goal
"Australia and New Zealand have conquered the world for a long time. But we've finally broken that seal."
England head coach Tracey Neville was speaking after the team recorded the greatest result in their history, beating overwhelming favourites Australia 52-51 to win a first Commonwealth gold medal.
A last-gasp goal secured victory by the smallest of margins, but handed England the biggest of results on the world stage.
At its most basic, this was the team ranked third in the world beating the team at the top of the standings for the first time in a major tournament.
But, as player-turned-pundit Tamsin Greenway told BBC Sport, it ensured netball has a "new world order".
This is how they did it...
England beat Australia to win historic gold
What happened on a dramatic final day on the Gold Coast
'A seismic shift in power'
England stats
England's primary aim coming into the Commonwealth Games was to reach the final. That would have been enough to make history.
Australia and New Zealand had contested all five finals since netball was introduced to the Games in 1998, but there were rumblings of an upset before the event.
England secured their best ever finish in the Quad Series in January, beating New Zealand and South Africa to finish second, with the former fast approaching a crisis.
And so it proved in the group. Neville's side eased through their pool, securing a record win over New Zealand in the process.
They almost faltered in the semi-final against Jamaica, but goal shooter Jo Harten scored the first of their last-second winners as England reached their first final at a major tournament.
Neville said her side could "just enjoy the final" - but they were not done yet.
Australia head coach Lisa Alexander said before the Games that there had been a "seismic shift of power".
But even she could not have predicted how seismic that shift would be.
English exodus paves way for gold
It's a pile-on! England stars watch their netball win for first time
In 2008, England goalkeeper Geva Mentor made a pioneering move which would help pave the way for their golden moment on the Gold Coast.
The Bournemouth-born defender became one of the first English players to feature in the Trans-Tasman domestic league.
And plenty of English players followed - including five of England's starting seven in Sunday's gold-medal match.
In fact, of their 12-strong squad on the Gold Coast, nine have played domestic netball in either Australia or New Zealand.
"It's made a tremendous impact," said Mentor. "We've had the skill and the talent, we just haven't had that mental belief to grind games out."
England netball results at the Commonwealth Games
Kuala Lumpur 1998: Bronze	Delhi 2010: Bronze
Manchester 2002: Fourth	Glasgow 2014: Fourth
Melbourne 2006: Bronze	Gold Coast 2018: Gold
Greenway - who won two Commonwealth bronze medals with England, and moved down under the same time as Mentor - agrees the Australian experience is "a game-changer".
"It's helped us hugely," she told BBC Sport. "They've opened their door, created that competition and swept up all the best players across the world.
"England players are their team-mates now, and the players are no longer untouchable. There is no fear."
Mentor, who captained Sunshine Coast Lightning to the 2017 Super Netball title, faced team-mate Caitlin Bassett in the final.
She was so dominant she forced the shooter to the bench at half-time.
"You're not looking at them as your heroes, they're your team-mates and someone you can beat up every day," added Greenway.
"Mentor showed that in the final. She's the only player who can get in Bassett's head, and she proved why she's the best goalkeeper in the world."
Gold medal a long time coming
Commonwealth Games: Mike Bushell is a splash hit with England netball team
England have come agonisingly close to upsetting the odds in the past.
At the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, they led New Zealand in the pool and Australia in the semi-final, before faltering in the final quarters of both matches.
In Glasgow in 2014, they lost to Australia by a single point in the group, and by the same margin to New Zealand in the semi-finals. They finished fourth.
They went one better at the 2015 World Cup - winning bronze - but there were fractures behind the scenes and their assault on the top two looked to have stalled.
Neville, the interim head coach during the World Cup, got the role on a permanent basis in September 2015 and set to work on the team's mentality.
"We said after Glasgow they needed to grow in mentality," she told BBC Sport.
"Over time, they've been exposed in different ways but they've flourished as individuals, and as a team they became gold medal-winning."
Mentor added: "We've had talented girls over the years, but what has changed is the belief and confidence we've had.
"We've been talking the talk for a number of years so to finally be able to get out there and show what we're made of, I hope it's a sign of good things to come."
Bigger than the World Cup?
Helen Richardson-Walsh
Of all the sports on the Gold Coast, netball perhaps boasts the strongest field.
The top 12 teams in the world qualified for the Games, and a Commonwealth gold medal is as sought after as the World Cup title - if not more so.
Netball has Olympics status but has never been included in a Games, so this is its only opportunity to be a part in a multi-sport event.
England revelled in the opportunity - despite the weight of history being against them.
In the five Commonwealth Games prior to those on the Gold Coast, Australia had only lost two of 40 matches - both gold-medal finals against New Zealand.
But the 10-time outright World Cup winners relinquished their seemingly unbeatable status at home as England spoiled their party.
What next?
England netball
England will host the Netball World Cup in Liverpool in July 2019
"We just hope every little girl watching grows up and wants to be an England netball player."
That was the view of England centre Jade Clarke, who came on in the final quarter to win her 150th England cap.
The 34-year-old, now a veteran of four Commonwealth Games, is one of four England players aged 30 or over in the squad.
Indeed next year's home World Cup - which takes place in Liverpool in July - could well be the swansong for a large portion of this England side.
And they have their sights set on backing up Sunday's historic victory with another.
"This group has to stay together," said Greenway. "They'll want to finish off this four years. They are now the team to beat, but they shouldn't be fearful."Commonwealth Games: England win netball gold on dramatic final day

England's route to the netball gold-medal match had not been without drama, as they fought back to beat Jamaica 56-55 in the semi-final.
But the tension was ramped up several notches in a fiercely contested final on the Gold Coast.
Australia, buoyed by a home crowd and the world number one ranking, opened a four-point lead in the final quarter, but Tracey Neville's side fought their way back into the game.
Having pulled level at 51-51, Housby scored in the last second to give England victory in their first appearance in a major final.
It was the first time since netball was introduced at the Games in 1998 that Australia and New Zealand had not contested the final, and surpassed the Roses' previous best result of silver in a round-robin World Cup in 1975.
"It's my dream come true," said head coach Neville. "The girls have worked so hard over the last international phase.
"Australia are the renowned world number ones and to beat them at that time, I'm really, really proud - the feeling of that is amazing."
Hawkins collapses in marathon lead
Scotland's Hawkins collapses in marathon
Scotland's Hawkins had a two-minute lead with little more than a mile to go in the men's marathon when he began to weave, before falling over on the kerb.
In hot conditions, the 25-year-old continued for another couple of hundred metres before collapsing again, hitting his head on a roadside barrier.
He was taken away in an ambulance and was sitting up and talking, but questions were raised over why medical staff took a couple of minutes before attending to him.
BBC Sport commentator Steve Cram said it was "a disgrace".
But Peter Jardine of Scottish Athletics told BBC Scotland that Hawkins, who had been running for a little over two hours, initially refused medical treatment after collapsing because he "feared he would be disqualified".
Australia's Michael Shelley took gold, with Hawkins' team-mate Simpson claiming bronze.
Elsewhere, John Smith took silver in the men's T54 marathon ahead of fellow Englishman Simon Lawson. Compatriot Jade Jones was third in the women's race.

England's Chris and Gabby Adcock retained badminton mixed doubles title
England were guaranteed a gold medal in the badminton mixed doubles with the Adcocks facing team-mates Marcus Ellis and Lauren Smith in the final.
It was the husband-and-wife pairing who secured a 19-21 21-17 21-16 victory, but Ellis bounced back to win the men's doubles gold alongside Chris Langridge. Smith and Sarah Walker lost in the women's doubles final.
Those medals meant England's badminton team secured their best Commonwealth haul in 16 years.
Elsewhere, England's Liam Pitchford and Tin-Tin Ho took mixed double table tennis silver after losing the final to Singapore's Ning Gao and Mengyu Yu, while countryman Samuel Walker missed out on singles bronze to India's four-time Games gold medallist Sharath Achanta.
English duo Daryl Selby and Adrian Waller claimed a silver medal after their defeat by Australian pair David Palmer and Zac Alexander in the men's squash doubles final.
Compatriots James Willstrop and Declan James beat Scotland's Alan Clyne and Greg Lobban 11-9 11-9 to win bronze.
England also clinched rugby sevens bronze in both the men's and women's events with a 21-14 victory over South Africa and 24-19 success against Canada respectively.
However, Scotland missed out on a bronze in the men's basketball after a 79-69 defeat by New Zealand in their medal match.

Scotland's Hawkins collapses in marathon
Scotland's Callum Hawkins was taken away in an ambulance after collapsing just over one mile from the end of the marathon at the Commonwealth Games.
In hot conditions on the Gold Coast, the 25-year-old had a two-minute lead and looked set for gold but began weaving before falling over the kerb.
He continued for another couple of hundred metres before collapsing again, hitting his head on a roadside barrier.
Hawkins was conscious, sitting up and talking when helped into an ambulance.
Compatriot Robbie Simpson took bronze in a race won by Australia's Mike Shelley in two hours 16 minutes 46 seconds, with Uganda's Munyo Solomon Mutai second.
Team Scotland said Hawkins would remain in Gold Coast University Hospital overnight as a precaution and will be assessed on Monday by their medical team.
Hawkins said he was "feeling much better".
Peter Jardine of Scottish Athletics had earlier told BBC Scotland that Hawkins, who had been running for a little over two hours, initially refused medical treatment after collapsing because he "feared he would be disqualified".
Scotland's Steph Twell, who finished seventh in the 1500m, ran to the scene and helped Hawkins as he was taken away.

Medical help 'a disgrace'
It had taken a couple of minutes for any medical staff to attend to the Scot, who was lying on the road in clear distress with spectators looking on, some taking photographs.
BBC Sport commentator Steve Cram said it was "a disgrace" it took so long for any paramedics to attend to Hawkins.
Cram added: "I'm just concerned for his welfare. He hit his head on the barrier. I'm sorry if you're watching this at home, it's really distressing. He's going to hurt himself and there's nobody anywhere near.
"We should have some more medical attention. This is a guy in real distress and someone needs to recognise it for his health at this point.
"Where on earth is the help? You cannot just wait at the finish line. They've got radios. And finally somebody arrives. I think it's disgraceful."
When asked to explain why it took so long for paramedics to attend to Hawkins, Gold Coast organising committee (GOLDOC) chief executive Mark Peters said: "We need to check the facts out. You can't have medical people on every kilometre of the road.
"They are professionally positioned as they are for our Gold Coast marathon when we have 30,000 people running. Obviously the health of the athlete is absolute prime.
"Sometimes medical people arrive and athletes have to make a decision whether they want to go on or not and I understand that was part of the discussion."
Team Scotland said: "Whilst Callum's recovery is our clear priority, we are still reviewing the circumstances of today's race with GOLDOC and the Commonwealth Games Federation to ensure the continued health and wellbeing of all athletes remains paramount."

'There's rarely a marathon where someone isn't collapsing'
Peters said he was attempting to get more information, adding: "There is no reason there would be deliberate delays and our thoughts are with the athlete."
He also said he did not think the heat - the temperature was about 28C - was a problem.
"Athletes run in snow, they run in 30-odd degree heat so we don't think that's an issue," he said.
"Unfortunately athletes do run themselves to exhaustion and there is rarely a marathon where someone isn't collapsing."
GOLDOC later released a statement which confirmed "medical staff were posted at 500m intervals in the final kilometres of the course" and all staff "had radio communications".
It added: "In competition there are strict rules around accepting medical help and subsequent disqualification. After Callum Hawkins collapsed on the bridge, medical staff provided treatment when requested."
In the statement Peters said he "was concerned about the behaviour of a small number of bystanders who chose to take images". He added: "This is not in keeping with the spirit of GC2018."
Shelley said: "I saw him on the Sundale Bridge and just tried to hang on.
"When I was coming down the home straight I tried to accelerate but I was just gone. I thought hopefully I can get to the finish line because I was starting to get cramps in my hands."
The dilemmas facing a marathon runner
Callum Hawkins collapses in the marathon
Hawkins was on the tarmac for several minutes before medical help arrived
Simpson told BBC Sport he had sympathy for Hawkins because marathon runners have "always got conflict because part of the race is not listening to your body".
He added: "You've got to push through the wall. When you get tired you can't slow down, you have to fight all the way to the end. And that's what Callum was doing.
"I never felt too bad, I was tired, it was hot but it always felt manageable, on the right side of what was safe."
He said he could "understand" why Hawkins did not want medical treatment.
"I've been in the same situation in the heat and I was hallucinating," said Simpson.
You have these feelings of the overwhelming heat, like being in an oven
Bronze medalist Robbie Simpson on what it's like to collapse during a race
"So what you think you want - sometimes you get ideas in you head that you think is what's happening - can be quite different from reality.
"He didn't think he was as bad as what he was but it could have been worse if he did keep going.
"You don't know what damage you can do by collapsing in this heat.
"Laying on the hot tarmac is so much worse. You have these feelings of the overwhelming heat, like being in an oven.
"What kept me going was moving and a bit of the breeze and then just getting straight into the recovery tent with ice and the cold drinks."
When asked about running past his team-mate, Simpson said: "It was pretty horrible.
"I kind of look up to Callum as being someone who has been there, at the World Championships, getting fourth place and having the Scottish record for the half marathon.
"So to see someone like that, who I respect so much just lying there, it was awful."
Hawkins was not the only athlete to suffer in the conditions - Tanzania's Stephano Huche Gwandu was put in a wheelchair after falling as he crossed the finish line.
His team-mate Saidi Juma Makula collapsed close to the finish line - one of seven of the 24 starters who did not complete the race - and was helped into an ambulance.Commonwealth Games: Hayley Simmonds' road to bronze sees her drop seven stone

Commonwealth Games: Road racer Simmonds claims bronze in women's time trial
England's Hayley Simmonds claimed Commonwealth Games bronze in the women's time trial and tears of joy quickly followed the latest high in a remarkable transition.
The 29-year-old stood on the podium next to New Zealand's Linda Villumsen and Australia's gold medallist Katrin Garfoot, weighing almost half as much as she did when her cycling journey began in 2010.
What started as a way of lowering a peak weight of around 16st 5lbs (104kg) has led to a major podium, not to mention a drop of around seven stone (45kg).
She is a picture of sporting achievement yet says she remembers vividly the days where she would "hide in baggy clothes" to conceal her physique.
Commonwealth Games time trial
Simmonds, 29, switched from rowing to cycling in 2010
Simmonds embodied change as - hunched over her bike in the aero-tuck position - she set about adding bronze to the silver England's Harry Tanfield claimed earlier in the men's time trial.
"I've worked hard," she tells BBC Sport. "I was showing someone photos of me in 2011 and they didn't believe it was me."

BBC Sport's coverage times and channels
'Bye bye malt loaf and pasta'
Life changed for Simmonds after she competed for Cambridge as they claimed the Boat Race in 2009. The 5am rise to row before lectures stopped as her sporting nature was entirely sacrificed for study. Added weight soon followed.
"I wouldn't say I got away with it when I was rowing. When I did the boat race even at weigh-in day I was 86kg (13st 7lbs) I think," added Simmonds, who has a PhD in organic chemistry.
"I used to eat a lot of pasta and cheese - which is nice but not ideal.
"I think nutrition has come a long way in the time I have been in sport. When I was rowing in school we had a nutrition talk and I remember being told that when I've been out on a long row I can basically buy an entire malt loaf and eat it.
"I thought great, I like food, that sounds good."
Veggies
Simmonds often posts pictures of healthy meals on Instagram: "All the greens for dinner tonight! Chilli spiced chicken, kale and red onion with miso roasted broccoli"
Work with Michelin-starred chef and nutritionist Alan Murchison has helped Simmonds drop down to around nine stone. Carbohydrate intake has been drastically reduced in preference for a high-protein, gluten-free diet.
"At one point when I was trying to lose weight I would have a high-protein breakfast," added Simmonds. "So that might be steak and nuts. I don't do that anymore.
"Initially you can lose weight quite quickly and then it's a slow process. So within the period of losing weight I have changed what I have done.
"I feel more confident and better in myself. I don't worry about wearing baggy clothes to hide anymore. Even just general energy levels have transformed. It's hard to remember those times now."
'Lose an ounce gain a second'
And then of course there is cycling's part in the lifestyle switch. Her husband and coach Mark Holt gave her a bike in 2010 before training seriously a year later and achieving a sub 30-minute time trial close to her home.
Simmonds cries at the finish
Simmonds was incredibly emotional as she discovered she had claimed the bronze medal
With a mantra of "lose an ounce gain a second", she eventually won the British national time trial championships in 2015, the same year in which she clocked 19 minutes and 46 seconds for the distance.
Three-hour morning rides, or sessions on the turbo trainer twice a day have melted away mass from her 5ft 5in frame. To stand next to Simmonds now, you wonder how she actually carried the extra weight.
"As soon as I started cycling and doing evening time trials, my competitive nature took over," added the Redditch-born athlete.
Commonwealth Games time trial
Australia's Katrin Garfoot produced a dominant display to win gold, with Linda Villumsen of New Zealand in second.
"There have been times where I just wanted to go and eat a big cake but I'm lucky I have people supporting me. If I'm going for that slice of cake my husband may say 'do you really need that?'.
"Anyone can do it. It doesn't matter if your goal is a 30-minute time trial, just little, regular goals."
Making the Commonwealth podium is hardly a "little" goal. Simmonds admitted the sense of achievement felt "incredible" but she is already looking to make the British team at the 2020 Olympic Games.
There is now no more weight to really lose but given the focus which has brought her this far, reaching the sporting carnival in Tokyo two years from now would be another turn in Simmonds' transformation.

There's a lot to take in at the Commonwealth Games. Some of it can be a bit confusing.
Here are some of the weirdest FAQs cleared right up for you.
1. Is there actually an age limit on competitors?
Wales 11-year-old table tennis player, Anna Hursey, is one of the Commonwealth Games youngest ever competitors. 
She's also the youngest player ever to represent Wales at a senior level in any sport.
undefined thumbnail
1 min
Hursey beat Uganda's Halima Nambozo 4-0 in her opening group match, but lost 4-0 to Malaysia's Li Sian Alice Chang - ranked 126 places above her - in her second group game to miss out on a place in the last 32 of the women's singles.
At the other end of the spectrum, theres Canadas 79-year-old full bore shooter Robert Pitcairn  the oldest ever competitor at the Games. He also once foiled a hijacker on a flight, so there's that.
So, could you technically enter the Games as, say, a 90-year-old sprinter? Or a five-year-old cyclist?
"Each sport has an International Federation and that body sets age limits in their sport," Chris Jenkins from Commonwealth Games Wales told BBC Three. "For example, mountain biking is 21, but track cycling is lower. Table tennis does not have an age limit, while gymnastics has an age limit of 16."
Both the Olympics and Commonwealth Games leave decisions on age limits to the individual sports bodies, who are best able to assess risks and suitability.
2. Why do they give out green cards in hockey?
Green card hockeygettyimages
Havent watched any hockey since the Olympics? Confused as to why the ref keeps showing those green cards?
A green card is a warning, and can entail a temporary suspension for two minutes of playing time. A yellow card can result in the offending player being temporarily suspended for a minimum of five minutes, while the red card is for more serious offences.
Well, there, you know now.
3. Dont they have to wear protective head gear in the boxing events?
These Vou Siutu of Australia and Frazer Clarke of England compete during the Men's 91kg Quarterfinal Boxinggettyimages
Nope. The 2014 Commonwealth Games were the first time since 1982 that male boxers competed without head guards. The reasoning came from research showing there had actually been an increase in the number of head injuries since head gear was introduced to amateur boxing prior to the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games. 
"When you have a head guard on you are more likely to get an injury," explains Dr Mike Loosemore, lead consultant in sport and exercise medicine at the Institute of Sport Exercise & Health.
"There are several reasons for this: it could be that head guards restrict your vision slightly, so you dont see the punches coming, and maybe that the head guard increases the size of the head. But the most likely reason is people just feel more confident with a head guard on. They dont put their head in a position where it cant get hit."
4. Why do I feel myself suddenly drawn to lawn bowls?

This one's easy: The Reggae Rollers.
South Londoner Andrew Newell, 44, was inspired by film Cool Runnings to set up the Lawn Bowls Association and is representing Jamaica (through his parents' heritage) for the country's debut at the Commonwealth Games.
His idea was to get more coverage for the sport and encourage participation from younger and more diverse communities.

Also, these personalised lawn bowls are boss.
5. Are there Para-athletes at the Commonwealth Games?

The Gold Coast Commonwealth Games are hosting up to 300 Para-athletes and 38 medal events across seven sports. This is an increase of 45% (athletes) and 73% (medals) from the 2014 Glasgow Games.
6. Which country has the most interesting flag?
Mozambique flag bearerGettyimages
Probably Mozambique, whose flag includes an image of an AK47, with bayonet attached.
This is a controversial element of the flag: the gun is said to represent the country's fight for independence. Others, however, see it a provocative relic of the country's civil war. 
7. What happens if shuttlecock gets stuck in a racquet in the badminton during a rally? 
This.

England took the point. Is that really how you sort it out? Doesnt exactly seem fair, does it?
8. Who is the biggest character at the Games?
Makwalagettyimages
There are so many. But definitely in the running it has to be Isaac Makwala of Botswana. 
The soft-spoken runner is back on our screens after a controversial London 2017 World Championships, in which he caught norovirus and then famously did a load of press-ups to prove his fitness.

1 min
On Tuesday, he won gold in the 400m and celebrated by breaking out the press ups again. His dad, who's name is Wonderful Makwala, apparently disapproved of Isaac's running in the early days - but, safe to say, not any more.
Speaking of wonderful names, there's a basketball player at the Games called God'sgift Achiuwa.
9. Where do the Scottish beach volleyball team train?

For the most part, the teams have trained at Portobello Beach in Edinburgh, where there are permanent courts. 
However, in the run up to the Gold Coast Games they also had the support of a local farmer, who allowed them to put sand in his barn so that the teams could train away from the rain, snow and frozen sand.
10. How many events are there exactly?
Opening ceremonygettyimages
Absolutely loads, mate. In total, taking in every event across athletics, badminton, basketball, bowls, boxing, cycling, hockey, netball, shooting, squash, swimming, table tennis, volleyball, and weightlifting, over 11 days of competition - 2707, precisely. Count them for yourself here if you can be bothered. We just did and, to warn you, it probably wasnt worth the effort.

 Caroline Dubois
Caroline Dubois is now reconciled with her husband and teenage daughter, who are supporting her in Australia
Five years ago, Caroline Dubois hit rock bottom.
Her marriage had broken up, her daughter had been taken away by the authorities, and she was "drowning" herself in alcohol.
This week she will represent Tonga at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, having turned her life around through lawn bowls
The 53-year-old had not played the game until two years ago - and Tonga has no bowling greens.
"I went through a really tough time," she says. "I believe bowls saved my life.
"Five years ago my life was in a pit. I had lost my marriage. My daughter was taken away. I actually lost the plot and went down a really disruptive path.
"Every minute I had, I would find a bar, find drink, drowning myself. It was the perfect solution for me. Drown myself in drink and go to sleep."
Dubois was introduced to lawn bowls by her sister and niece. It had a dramatic effect on her life - she has stopped drinking and is focused on the sport she now loves.
"The family stepped in and said: 'Snap out of it.' That was a turning point in my life. I just committed myself to the cause."
Given the lack of facilities in Tonga, Dubois went to Auckland, New Zealand to play. It was soon apparent she had a talent.
As she prepares to compete in the women's pairs on the Gold Coast, she notes how quickly her life has changed.
"To bowl for two years and end up at the Commonwealth Games is very rare," she says. "Nobody does that.
"To be on that green against the toughest teams, I couldn't ask for anything more."
Dubois is now looking forward to playing against some of the best bowlers in the world.
But the biggest thrill for her is that her husband and daughter are back in her life, and in Australia to watch her compete.
"My family is in the stands supporting me, yelling," she says. "Listening to my daughter going 'go mummy!' is music to my ears.
"It's a happy ending."Commonwealth Games: Meet the oldest athlete in event's history

 Robert Pitcairn
At 79 years and nine months, Robert Pitcairn is not only the oldest athlete in this year's Games - he's also the oldest in the history of the Games
You've probably heard all about 11-year-old Anna Hursey, the youngest competitor at this year's Commonwealth Games.
Now, meet 79-year-old full bore shooter Robert Pitcairn... who's about to become your favourite story of the event.
Born in 1938  somewhat fittingly, in the same month the first Superman comic was released  Canadian Robert is not only this year's oldest competitor but he's also the proud owner of the "Oldest athlete in the history of the Games" title. So, he's a pretty big deal.
Robert Pitcairn
He's entered the history books as the oldest Commonwealth Game sathlete ever
"I feel honoured to set the new age record and grateful my health and athleticism made it possible for me to be competitive in the Gold Coast Games," Pitcairn said after a training session at the Belmont Shooting Centre.
At 79 years and nine months old, his debut at the Games on Monday will break the record previously held by England's Doreen Flanders, who took part in lawn bowls at Glasgow 2014 a few weeks after her 79th birthday.
Robert's quest to compete started in 1960 after he was introduced to shooting as an Air Force cadet. However, he was not able to be a serious contender for the Commonwealth Games until his retirement in 1998.
I feel honoured to set the new age record and grateful that my health and athleticism made it possible for me to be competitive in the Gold Coast Games
Robert Pitcairn
The oldest athlete in the history of the Games
After narrowly missing out on a spot for Manchester 2002, Robert was determined to invest more time in training for the trials for this year's Games.
During the last national trial, he shot flawlessly and grabbed one of two places for the Gold Coast  an achievement he describes as "the pinnacle of [my] long shooting career".
Now, you're probably wondering how he celebrated. Well, he replaced his 22-year-old shooting jacket with a brand new one in his beloved Canadian red and white colours.
Robert Pitcairn
The talented marksman nabbed the Grand Aggregate Prize in Bisley, UK at the top international full bore target rifle competition in 1965
And if the fact he's almost 80 and competing in a Commonwealth Games isn't enough of a reason to get behind him, Robert used to be a commercial pilot and is well known for his heroic past.
In 1974, he foiled a hijacker on a 737 he was flying with 120 passengers aboard. As you do...
He's even shared his expertise with his son Donald, who is also an accomplished rifle shooter. In fact, the pair both competed at the 2011 and 2015 World Long Range Rifle Championships.
Robert Pitcairn
Robert "enjoyed every hour" of his 24,612 fying hours on 65 different types of plane
But Robert, who turns 80 on 26 June, is not satisfied with merely being the oldest athlete in the Games' history. He wants more.
"My goal is to stand on the podium with my partner Nicole Rossignol in the pairs event, and then again for the individual event. I trained hard, I'm aiming for that, and I am going to get them," he said.
His quest begins on Monday with the Queen's Prize Pairs Finals, before the medal event the following day. He will also have another chance at securing a medal when he competes in the Queen's Prize Individual on Wednesday and Thursday, which culminates in a medal event on Saturday. Good luck, Robert!

Three-hour morning rides, or sessions on the turbo trainer twice a day have melted away mass from her 5ft 5in frame. To stand next to Simmonds now, you wonder how she actually carried the extra weight.
"As soon as I started cycling and doing evening time trials, my competitive nature took over," added the Redditch-born athlete.
Commonwealth Games time trial
Australia's Katrin Garfoot produced a dominant display to win gold, with Linda Villumsen of New Zealand in second.
"There have been times where I just wanted to go and eat a big cake but I'm lucky I have people supporting me. If I'm going for that slice of cake my husband may say 'do you really need that?'.
"Anyone can do it. It doesn't matter if your goal is a 30-minute time trial, just little, regular goals."
Making the Commonwealth podium is hardly a "little" goal. Simmonds admitted the sense of achievement felt "incredible" but she is already looking to make the British team at the 2020 Olympic Games.
There is now no more weight to really lose but given the focus which has brought her this far, reaching the sporting carnival in Tokyo two years from now would be another turn in Simmonds' transformation.Commonwealth Games: James Heatly family affair swells Scottish success

 James Heatly celebrates with his bronze medal
James Heatly celebrated winning a bronze - 60 years after his grandfather won Scotland's last Commonwealth diving medal
Young James Heatly has a bit of a way to go to match his grandfather's legacy in the Commonwealth Games, but in taking bronze on the diving board on Wednesday, he's made a fine start.
All he needs to do now to emulate the great man, Sir Peter, is win four more medals, then get appointed as Scotland's assistant team manager, then team manager, then vice-chairman of the organising committee, then team manager again, then team commandant, then chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation, then life vice-president.
Truth be told, it's a bit of an ask.
Before his death in 2015, Sir Peter had an involvement in 17 consecutive Commonwealth Games going back 64 years. No doubt, his spirit would have been in the air around the Heatly family at the Aquatic Centre when James was doing his thing and winning Scotland's first diving medal since Peter the patriarch was in his pomp.

James' father, Robert, tells a story. "My father carried the flag for Scotland in his third Commonwealth Games in 1958 in Cardiff," he says.
"The general team manager that year was a guy called Jim Grossart. Jim's neighbour was Ally McGregor, a former Scotland international swimmer. At my dad's funeral, Ally told us that Jim's widow had given him the flag that dad had carried in '58 and Ally presented it to James. It's a good luck charm. My dad encouraged James to get into diving, They would sit and have little chats."

The flag was brought to the Gold Coast and if you looked carefully you might have seen it waving when the bronze medal was won. What a moment for the Heatly family. Sixty-eight years after winning their first Commonwealth Games medal and 60 years after winning their last, they're back on the podium again.
This was a day when Scotland matched and then beat their target of 29 medals. Linda Pearson's bronze in the shooting made it 29 and not even a glorious amalgam of history's greatest mystics could have foreseen the identity of the athlete who would take Scotland to 30.
Dave 'The Rave' McMath, a 21-year-old engineer, whose profile in the preamble was not exactly of Eilidh Doyle proportions, literally fired Scotland into a new high in terms of number of medals won at a foreign Games.
By taking gold in the double trap shooting, the Scots had beaten their much-stated goal. It was their seventh gold to go with the 10 silver and 13 bronze already won.
McMath wins double trap gold and Isle of Man win first medal
Later, Heatly would make it 31 and Maria Lyle would make it 32 in the T35 100m at Carrara Stadium. With Reece McFadden winning his flyweight boxing quarter-final and John Docherty winning in the middleweight division, both of them are now in the medals as well. They're guaranteed a bronze at least. That's effectively 34 in the bag.
All of this moved the chair of Commonwealth Games Scotland, Paul Bush, to say that it was a "privilege" to be involved with this team.
"People might say that 29 was too easy a target, but it wasn't," said Bush. "It was a number based on scientific analysis. We have two more guaranteed medals in the boxing, so I think we'll kick on towards 35 pretty soon. If we got to 40 I'd be completely ecstatic.
"We have seven gold and we won 11 gold in Melbourne so we'd like to get close to that. It would be the real icing on the cake if we managed it, but it will be tough.
"I actually think it's been harder to win medals in some sports here than it was in Glasgow. Undoubtedly, there's been a resurgence in Australian sport. They've probably pushed themselves back on to the world stage. They certainly have done in cycling and swimming. They were world class.
"Remember that we had an influence on the programme in Glasgow. We could front-load the events to get momentum and also backload it to give ourselves chances at the end. It wasn't by chance that Hannah Miley, Ross Murdoch and Michael Jamieson were swimming on the first night and that the judo kicked in very early. It was all planned, but coming here we didn't have the power to do that. We had to live with somebody else's picks.
"It was tougher to get momentum but we got it with Marc Austin. It was harder to get medals in the pool because the Australians have been world class and they've had 10,000 people behind them while baying for our blood, but the swimmers did brilliantly."
Commonwealth Games: Scotland's 'Cinderellas' beat Nigeria to make basketball semi-finals
Between athletes and support staff, the Scotland travelling party numbers is almost 400. It has cost around £1.75m to get them here, to house them, to kit them out, to give them the facilities and the coaching and the care they need to perform. It's a fact, though, that one of the great feel-good stories is also one of the most troubling.
The basketball men created history by becoming the first team from Scotland to qualify for a semi-final in the Commonwealth Games. They did it with precious little funding and with the bare minimum support staff compared to other team sports like netball and hockey.
Basketball has lived a life of second-class citizens and yet they are four wins from four games and now have a semi-final against the host nation on Saturday. Their journey so far is an inspirational one of triumph over adversity.
For too long there has been lip service paid to basketball in Scotland and the wider UK. One of the wishes going forward is that the Gold Coast marks a turning point for a great sport that could fly if only those with influence over the purse strings showed a little more respect to what it could do for the youth of the country.
While we salute the Duncan Scotts and Mark Stewarts and Katie Archibalds, there is another great tale happening on the basketball court. Medal or no medal, captain Kieron Achara and his team will endure as one of the highlights.

 Pat McCormack, Katie and John Archibald, Luke McCormack, Aidan and Michaela Walsh, Elinor Barker, Jonny and Alistair Brownlee
The Charltons winning the World Cup for England, the Williams sisters smashing records in tennis, the Klitschkos' collective clout in boxing - sport has always featured famous sets of brothers and sisters.
The Brownlee brothers, who have been dominating men's triathlon for years, were one of the better-known sets of siblings heading to Australia for the Commonwealth Games, having finished first and second at Glasgow 2014.
This time, with Alistair and Jonny having missed out on the individual medals, they combined (along with Jessica Learmonth and Vicky Holland) to win mixed team silver.
But they're just one of the families who have been having a good time on the Gold Coast...
'Seeing Katie win gold got me going'
Katie Archibald
Scotland's Katie Archibald won bronze in the points race in Glasgow four years ago
Katie and John Archibald from Scotland won gold and silver respectively in cycling on the same day and John admitted his younger sister's earlier win had spurred him.
"The final was hard and the pressure was on, but she certainly put me in the mix," he said.
"The Archibalds aren't known for parties but this is going to be the biggest night we've had in a while," Katie told BBC Sport on Friday.
And she revealed to presenter Hazel Irvine on Wednesday that the two of them, their parents, uncle, sister, friends, boyfriend had all enjoyed a "big night".
"I got a call the next day as to how they woke up," Katie added. "They were probably in just as much pain as we were in after competing."

Her younger sister Megan - who revealed how they stumbled upon track cycling on their way to swimming lessons - now has until Saturday to see if she can add to the family's medal collection in the road race.
But they've already had another victory as Elinor revealed after her win that it had been the first time that all six of her family had been in the same room "for almost a year and a half".

Elliot Daly will make his first start at full-back for England in Sunday's non-cap match against the Barbarians at Twickenham.
There are four uncapped players in the XV, with Henry Trinder at outside centre and Jack Singleton, Elliott Stooke and Zach Mercer in the forwards.
Regular full-back Mike Brown is on the wing, with George Ford and Chris Robshaw the co-captains.
"The match is a fantastic opportunity," said head coach Eddie Jones.
"We've always wanted to try Elliot at 15 and we also think (Mike) Browny can be an absolutely outstanding left winger for us."
Daly's outgoing Wasps team-mate Danny Cipriani is among the replacements, after being named in the squad for the first time under Jones.
Jones added: "If I wanted to make headlines [I would pick him to start], if I wanted to pick the best team then no [I won't]. He's in the 23 this week and he has a fantastic opportunity off the bench."
Scrum-half Dan Robson is also on the bench, along with fellow uncapped players hooker George McGuigan, prop Nick Schonert and utility forward Josh Beaumont.
"This is a good young squad and their work ethic has been outstanding over the last two weeks," Jones said.
"It is a great opportunity for them to show they deserve to wear the English rose, to show they can be in contention for the World Cup and a great opportunity for them to put us on the front foot ahead of the South Africa tour."
The Barbarians have named a strong squad for the Twickenham clash, with former England winger Chris Ashton and Scotland fly-half Finn Russell part of a star-laden backline.
"You never know what to expect from the Barbarians team," Jones added.
"We know they will be well coached by Pat Lam, we know they have got good individual players and some outstanding individual players, so we need to be up for the unexpected.
"We can't wait to get back to Twickenham and get on the front foot, please the fans and play some good rugby."
England's last game at Twickenham ended in defeat to Ireland as they lost their Six Nations crown

Sunday's match will be England's first game since news of defence coach Paul Gustard's upcoming move to Harlequins later this summer, and Jones said: "Our coaches have been approached consistently.
"I'm pleased for him, he wants to be a head coach and he's been deemed good enough so it's a great reward for him and his coaching.
"We are obviously disappointed from a team perspective, but then it creates another opportunity for us to bring in a coach that can build on the great work he has done."
Fly-half George Ford said: "Gussy is a world-class coach, his impact has been phenomenal and it's going to be a great miss for us.
"But we are proud for him. He'll be missed but it's not a bad thing to freshen things up sometimes, so it's exciting moving forward as well."
With eight uncapped players included in the match day squad, Ford says the new faces have brought lots of energy and have even had to be told to "taper down" during training sessions.
Ben Youngs returns to the starting line-up for the first time since England won away in Rome on the opening weekend of the Six Nations, and Ford says his Leicester team-mate's inclusion is a "massive bonus because of his international experience".
England side to play Barbarians: Elliot Daly (Wasps); Jonny May (Leicester), Henry Trinder (Gloucester), Piers Francis (Northampton), Mike Brown (Harlequins); George Ford (Leicester), Ben Youngs (Leicester); Joe Marler (Harlequins), Jack Singleton (Worcester), Kyle Sinckler (Harlequins), Elliott Stooke (Bath), Joe Launchbury (Wasps), Chris Robshaw (Harlequins), Tom Curry (Sale), Zach Mercer (Bath)

Betfred Super League
Castleford (4) 18
Tries: McMeeken, Hitchcox, Trueman, Holmes Goals: Ellis
St Helens (22) 40
Tries: Amor, Barba, Lomax, Peyroux, Morgan 2, Fages 2 Goals: Richardson 4
St Helens extended their lead at the top of Super League as they overcame Castleford Tigers at the Jungle.
Kyle Amor touched down inside three minutes for Saints but Cas responded immediately through Mike McMeeken.
Ben Barba ran 90 metres to run-in an incredible try while Jonny Lomax and Dominique Peyroux extended their lead.
Ryan Morgan and Theo Fages crossed twice for Saints but Jy Hitchcox, Jake Trueman and Oliver Holmes helped the hosts finish the match with a flourish.
The victory puts Saints four points clear of second-placed Wigan Warriors, however the Cherry and Whites have two games in hand. Meanwhile Castleford remain fifth.
There was controversy when Barba ran in Saints' second try as his incredible end-to-end run began with what some inside the Jungle thought was a knock-on.
However, television replays showed that Chris Kendall was correct to allow play to continue as the ball bounced slightly behind Barba, after Adam Swift struggled to deal with a high Castleford kick, before he started his stunning solo try.
It was the second time in 12 days that Barba had run the length of the field to score at the Jungle, having done the same in Saints' 36-18 Challenge Cup win, where the Australian had scored a hat-trick.
Despite Hitchcox, Trueman and Holmes cutting the deficit for the Tigers late in the second half, Saints held on to seal a second win in two matches against Castleford at the Jungle since Cas' dramatic golden point win in the 2017 Super League semi-finals.
Castleford coach Daryl Powell: "We started with a real verve about us with the ball and put them under pressure but we just couldn't defend.
"Players have got to be able to do their jobs better. Too many of our players have to change if we are to have a chance of doing anything.
"We cared about defence last year and I don't think we cared as much tonight. We need to work harder and we need to be tougher.
"We're getting some tough things happening to us, we lost Benny Roberts and had to completely reshuffle and we can't get a decision going our way. I thought the officiating was as bad as us tonight."
Saints coach Justin Holbrook: "We're a good side but there are plenty of good sides in the competition.
"I said earlier in the year all the teams will get better as the year goes on and we're no different. We want to keep getting better."
Castleford: Shenton, Minikin, Roberts, Foster, Hitchcox, Ellis, Trueman, Watts, McShane, Sene-Lefao, Holmes, McMeeken, Milner.
Replacements: Moors, Millington, Massey, Cook.
St Helens: Barba, Swift, Morgan, Percival, Grace, Lomax, Richardson, Amor, Roby, Thompson, Peyroux, Taia, Wilkin.
Replacements: Fages, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Douglas, Knowles.

 Rafael Nadal won his 10th Roland Garros title last year
Spain's Rafael Nadal won his 10th Roland Garros title in Paris last year
2018 French Open
Venue: Roland Garros, Paris Dates: 27 May-10 June
Coverage: Daily live radio and text commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live and the BBC Sport website
Sharp terracotta clay courts, luscious backdrops with the Eiffel Tower looming in the distance, rows of pristine Parisians wearing Panama hats... unmistakeably the French Open at Roland Garros.
The second Grand Slam of the tennis calendar - and the only major on clay - begins on Sunday.
Spain's 16-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal is still the man to beat in Paris, while 23-time major winner Serena Williams is the star attraction in the women's draw.
However, two of the biggest names will not be playing in the French capital - 20-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer and Britain's former world number one Andy Murray.
In Murray's absence, the British charge will be led by Kyle Edmund in the men's draw and Johanna Konta in the women's.
Here's everything you need to know...

Who can stop the King of Clay?
Beating Nadal on a clay court is the ultimate challenge in tennis - a notion both 12-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic and three-time Grand Slam champion Murray agree on.
And, once again, the 31-year-old Spaniard is the favourite to win at Roland Garros.
Nadal triumphed in Paris last year, becoming the first player - male or female - to win the same Grand Slam tournament 10 times in the Open era.
Worryingly for his rivals, he has picked up where he left off last year on the clay, lifting his 11th titles in Monte Carlo and Barcelona on his way to a record 50-set winning streak on a single surface.
Eventually that run came to an end in a defeat by Dominic Thiem in Madrid - Nadal's first loss on clay since the Austrian world number eight beat him in Rome 12 months previously.
Normal service resumed for the Spaniard at the Italian Open, a gutsy three-set victory over Germany's in-form Alexander Zverev giving him an eighth title in Rome, and helping him regain the world number one ranking from long-time rival Roger Federer.
Nevertheless Nadal - who begins his defence against Ukraine's Alexandr Dolgopolov - deflected talk of lifting the Coupe des Mousquetaires for an 11th time following his win in Rome.
"Conditions in Paris are completely different," he said. "I don't believe that what happened, even if I lost - even with the victory - creates a big impact about what can happen in Paris."
Where's Federer?
Roger Federer will not play at the French Open
Federer waved 'au revoir' until the summer following his Miami Open defeat in March
For the second year running, Federer - who turns 37 in August - has decided to skip the entire clay-court season.
When announcing his decision last year, he spoke about the need to be smart with his scheduling to prolong his career, and the French Open - on his least favourite surface and a tournament which he has won only once in 2009 - has been sacrificial.
The decision proved to be a sensible one last year as a refreshed Federer returned to the court for the grass season, going on to lift a record eighth Wimbledon title.
The Swiss maestro regained the world number one ranking in February after a blistering start to the year in which he claimed the Australian Open during a 17-match winning run.
But successive defeats - by Juan Martin del Potro in the Indian Wells final, followed by a shock loss against injury-hit Australian Thanasi Kokkinakis - preceded the announcement Federer would again skip Roland Garros.
Federer has not played in Paris since 2015, leading to some suggestions - including from his old rival - that he does not fancy meeting Nadal on clay.
Edmund ready for first Slam as Britain's top man
Kyle Edmund
Edmund, ranked 17th, has broken into the world's top 20 for the first time
With Murray still not fully recovered from hip surgery, Edmund goes into his first Grand Slam as the British number one.
It is the first Slam since the 2006 US Open where three-time major champion Murray has not been ranked as the country's leading player.
Of course, Edmund has played on the biggest stage without Murray's shadow looming - most notably at the Australian Open in January.
The 22-year-old became only the sixth British man in the Open era to reach a Grand Slam semi-final, seeing his remarkable run ended in the last four by Croatia's 2014 US Open champion Marin Cilic.
Since then the Yorkshireman has also beaten 2016 French Open champion Djokovic in Madrid, helping him climb into the world's top 20 for the first time.
He will begin his campaign against young Australian Alex de Minaur.
Cameron Norrie is the only other Briton in the men's singles draw. The world number 102, who shot to prominence in the Davis Cup defeat by Spain in March, has gained direct entry to a Grand Slam for the first time and will face Germany's Peter Gojowczyk in the first round.
Who can stop Nadal?
Alexander Zverev: The man identified by many as Nadal's biggest threat. The 21-year-old German is the leading player on the ATP Tour this year, having won 30 matches and claimed clay-court titles in Munich and Madrid. However, he has never gone past the last 16 of a Grand Slam.
Marin Cilic: The powerful Croat reached a career-high third in the world following his run to the Australian Open final, but has never gone beyond the last eight at Roland Garros. Runs to the Monte Carlo quarter-finals and Rome semi-finals, however, have left the 29-year-old hoping he can go deep in the draw in Paris.
Novak Djokovic: The once-dominant Serb has dropped down the rankings after an elbow injury which has disrupted his career since Wimbledon. He is now ranked 22nd in the world, but showed glimpses of returning to his best form with a run to the Italian Open semi-finals this month.
Dominic Thiem: The one man to have beaten Rafael Nadal on clay in the past two years. And it is a feat the 24-year-old Austrian has achieved twice - in Rome last year and in Madrid earlier this month. He is yet to transfer his talent into major prizes, having still not managed to land a Masters title, although he has reached the Roland Garros semi-finals for two years running.
Stan Wawrinka: A frustrating year for the 2015 champion, who has been sidelined by a knee injury for much of the past year. The 33-year-old Swiss has reached at least the semi-finals in each of the past three years, but a lack of time on court means a similar feat this year might be beyond him.
Men's seeds
Serena out of match practice - but 'can still win'
Serena Williams
Serena Williams is aiming for a first Grand Slam title since having a baby
Serena Williams has only played four Tour matches since returning to the court after giving birth to daughter Alexis in September - but that has not stopped coach Patrick Mouratoglou saying the 23-time Grand Slam champion can still win in Paris.
Williams, 36, lost to older sister Venus in the last 32 in Indian Wells on her WTA return in March, then went out to Japan's rising star Naomi Osaka in round one at Miami a fortnight later.
The former world number one has plummeted to 453rd in the world rankings, but is able to use her protected ranking to play at Roland Garros. The unseeded American starts against Czech Kristyna Pliskova.
If she does win a fourth French Open singles crown, although there are still question marks about her fitness and sharpness, it will take her level with Margaret Court's all-time Grand Slam record of 24 majors.

Halep leads the female contenders
Simona Halep: The Romanian goes into the tournament as the world number one and the leading player on the WTA Tour this year, hoping this will be the moment she finally lands her first Grand Slam title. However, she has won only one of her past eight finals - including defeat by Jelena Ostapenko in last year's Roland Garros showpiece.
Caroline Wozniacki: The Dane landed her first Grand Slam title with victory over Halep at the Australian Open in January and is second in the year's Race to Singapore standings. Clay, however, is not her favourite surface, having never won a title on the red dirt.
Elina Svitolina: For the second year running, the Ukrainian world number four goes into Roland Garros as the Italian Open champion. In contrast to Halep, whom she beat in Rome, Svitolina has won her past eight finals - although has never reached a Grand Slam semi-final.
Jelena Ostapenko: The unseeded Latvian shocked the world 12 months ago when her all-out attacking game led to her an unlikely Roland Garros victory - just two days after her 20th birthday. She has maintained her place in the world's top 10 since, despite a patchy 2018 which has brought only one final. But she cannot be counted out - especially with the experience of savouring victory - to succeed again on her favoured surface.
Maria Sharapova: A two-time champion at Roland Garros, the Russian will be among the seeds for the first time at a Grand Slam since returning from a 15-month doping ban last year.
Women's seeds
Konta aiming to prove she can compete on clay
British number one Johanna Konta showed she was among the best on grass during her memorable run to the Wimbledon semi-finals last year, but it has been a different story on clay.
The 27-year-old only managed to win two matches on the surface last year, and has never progressed past the first round at Roland Garros.
But she showed encouraging signs by reaching the last 16 in Rome before losing to Ostapenko.
'I've never believed that I'm not good on this surface," said Konta, who plays Kazakhstan's Yulia Putintseva in the opening round.
Konta has slipped to 22nd in the world rankings since her Wimbledon heroics propelled her to a career-high fourth, reaching just one quarter-final this year.
She is joined in the main draw by Heather Watson, who has also struggling for form but ended a four-month losing streak this week with a victory in Nuremberg.
The 26-year-old has dropped to 87th in the rankings and starts against home hopeful Oceane Dodin.
Also in the main draw - representing Australia - is Inverness-raised Isabelle Wallace. The 21-year-old left the Highlands at the age of 10 due to a lack of funding and tennis resources and now lives in Spain.
However, she told BBC Sport that she will be representing Scotland when she opens against Alison van Uytvanck of Belgium.
"Even though I'm Australian, everyone back home is full of support. I still think of myself as Scottish," she said. "I think a lot of people would understand in my situation and it's the right thing to."
Prize money at the French Open
Last year's singles champions Jelena Ostapenko and Rafael Nadal took home about 2.16m (£1.9m) each. (Prize money in British pounds: Winner £1.93m; Runner-up £984,000; Semis £492,000; Quarters £334,000; Last 16 £195,000)

 Rory McIlroy
Rory McIlroy's last European Tour win was at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open in May 2016
Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy has stormed into the clubhouse lead at the BMW PGA Championship after a seven-under 65 in round two at Wentworth.
The world number eight, 29, who won the title in 2014, leads on 12 under par.
McIlroy, a four-time major champion, holed four successive birdies on the back nine in his bogey-free round with no other player within three shots.
England's Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are among the later starters at the European Tour's flagship event.
Live second round leaderboard
England's Robert Rock shot a 68 to move to seven under alongside Sweden's defending champion Alex Noren and Thailand's Kiradech Aphibarnrat and that trio are the closest contenders in the clubhouse.
Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell is a shot back from that trio, after his 67 took him to six under alongside South Africa's Branden Grace.
Former world number one Lee Westwood's 69 took him to five under, level with fellow Englishman Andy Sullivan. Scotland's Richie Ramsay, England's Chris Wood and Ireland's Shane Lowry are at four under, while Paul Casey is on two under.
McIlroy's 'best' round of 2018
McIlroy had trailed by two shots overnight, and missed short putts on the first three holes.
But he led by the turn after three birdies and extended his advantage by gaining shots on the 12th, 13th, 14th and 15th.
He was unable to birdie the 16th or 17th and had to settle for another par on the 18th after his approach to the par-five green plugged in a bunker.
"That was the best I have played this year," said McIlroy. "I took my chances, but was disappointed with the two fives coming in.
"I played with the same strategy as yesterday, played smart and depending on where I finish at the end of the day I might have a little bit of a cushion.
"But I still have to play aggressive [for the rest of the weekend] because these guys are shooting low scores."

Muir breaks Holmes' 1500m British record
London Anniversary Games, London Stadium
Date: Saturday, 21 July - Sunday, 22 July Time: 13:15-17:15 BST Saturday, 13:00-17:00 Sunday
Coverage: Saturday live on BBC1, Sunday live on BBC2
Laura Muir will attempt to set a new British mile record at the London Anniversary Games on Sunday, 22 July.
The double world indoor medallist broke Kelly Holmes' 1500m British record at the same event in 2016.
Now the 25-year-old Scot hopes to beat Zola Budd's 33-year-old record of four minutes 17.57 seconds over a mile.
"The mile has a special place in British distance running history so it's super we are getting a chance to race the mile," Muir said.
Muir second in mile with personal best
Muir just missed out on bettering Budd's mark at last year's London Anniversary Games, when she finished second in a time of 4:18.03 at London Stadium.
She added: "First and foremost, I am looking to win the race, but in doing so if I can break the British record that would be fantastic. It'd be somewhat fitting in a year in which we lost the legendary Sir Roger Bannister."
Cherry Alexander, major events director at UK Athletics, added: "We all remember that stunning night at the event two years ago when she lowered the 1500m record and claimed a remarkable victory.
"The noise of the British crowd really did make a difference on that night, which does show there is nothing quite like home support."Winter Olympics: Nine unlikely stars of Pyeongchang 2018

 Eight stars from the games
Inpersonators, animals and athletes - the stars took all different forms
Mikaela Shiffrin, Shaun White, Marcel Hirscher, Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir - all the big names lived up to the hype when their moment arrived.
But what of the Winter Olympics' surprises?
There were a few, and not all came in the form of shock gold medals.
Let's take a look at the unlikely stars of Pyeongchang 2018...
The squirrel with a death wish
There really had to be an animal in this list - and the penultimate day of competition delivered the goods.
Milena Bykova, competing for the neutral Olympic athletes from Russia team, narrowly avoided squishing the little critter on her run in the snowboarding giant slalom.
The slow motion replay shows it JUST got away unharmed - bar the inevitable palpitations.
Gold medal for bravery to that squirrel.

Everyone at the finish line of the 15km cross country
Bookmark this page for those moments you need a pick-me-up, or even a little cry.
Tongan taekwondo fighter turned cross country skier Pita Taufatofua, known as "the topless Tongan", finished 114th in the 15km race.
The 34-year-old may have been 23 minutes slower than the gold medallist but he didn't see that as failure.
His aim was to not ski into a tree and to finish before they turned out the lights. Nailed it.
Not only that, but he displayed outstanding sportsmanship, waiting at the finish line for last-placed German Madrazo before hoisting the 43-year-old Mexican onto his shoulders.
Despite the freezing conditions, the crowds stayed the extra half an hour to cheer on the remaining finishers.
Hot chocolates all round.

Kenworthy and his boyfriend
Freestyle skier Gus Kenworthy, despite his 12th place finish, says this Olympics was more fulfilling than when he won a silver medal in Sochi four years ago.
Why?
"Because I did it as me" he told CNN.
Kenworthy, who came out as gay in 2015, shared a kiss with boyfriend Matthew Wilkas before his qualifying run, a moment that has become a viral sensation and been hailed as a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender pride.
"My childhood self would never have dreamed of seeing a gay kiss on TV at the Olympics, but for the first time ever a kid watching at home CAN! Love is love is love." he added.

Howard - the Kim Jong-un lookalike
A Kim Jong-un impersonator made the headlines when he was removed from the ice hockey arena, having tried to join in with the North Korean cheerleaders during the unified Korean women's ice hockey team's match against Japan.
The imposter, who identified himself only as Howard, was filmed shaking hands with crowd members as he was escorted out of the arena by security.
He reportedly claimed he had not committed any crime by looking like the North Korean president and cheering a hockey team.
Earlier, he gatecrashed the opening ceremony with a doppelganger of US president Donald Trump.
"My face is too political," he said. "I was born with this face, I've got to live with it."

Facial hair
These Olympics gave us two of best moustaches we have seen. Possibly ever.
American Matt Hamilton was the proud owner of one of them - and it was clearly lucky as the United States upset the odds to beat favourites Sweden to gold in the men's curling.

Excellently manicured...
The 'Garlic Girls'
In a country which only a few weeks ago had barely heard of curling, the South Korean national team became superstars.

The "Garlic Girls" are so named because of the small garlic-producing region they come from.
Then there are the names they gave each other after sitting down for breakfast one day: Steak, Yogurt, Pancake, Sunny and Chocho.
They appear so modest, but these incredible, determined underdogs won comfortably against established curling nations such as Canada, Great Britain and the US and made it all the way to the gold medal match.
The Swedes has clearly not read the script though - they beat the home side 8-3 in the final.

Fashion... (darling)
We have seen some outstanding outfits from competitors and fans alike in South Korea.

The 'Passion Crew'
BBC Sport's Nick Hope in Pyeongchang:
16,000 volunteers from 62 countries played a role in the Games
The stars of the Games - unofficially
London 2012 had its 'Games Makers', Sochi 2014 its 'Ice Makers' and Baku 2015 the 'Flame Makers' - all of whom were brilliant - but the volunteers at Pyeongchang 2018 have been on another level.
They may have been given an official - and somewhat unfortunate - "Passion Crew" title but they have lived up to that enthusiastic billing with constant energy and countless 'Gangnam Style' dance renditions.
Friendly, phenomenally good at English and always smiling, they helped lift the spirits of athletes, coaches, media and spectators during the most brutal sub-zero temperatures in South Korea.
The unofficial stars of the Games.
Big air
What a spectacle. A new event for this Olympics and we certainly hope it is here to stay.
The women's competition allowed the athletes to show their full potential, after bad weather made for a chaotic slopestyle final, with Austria's Anna Gasser the pre-games favourite proving her star quality.
And as for the men's final - well, Team GB found themselves a flag bearer.

Ledecka claims double gold with snowboard slalom victory
What do you do when you can't choose between skiing and snowboarding?
Well, if you're Ester Ledecka, you do both. You even take your indecision to Olympic level and win double gold.
The 22-year-old Czech had never even stood on an alpine skiing World Cup podium until last Saturday morning when she took the greatest prize in the sport, stunning even herself to win Olympic super G gold.
But her favoured event was still to come and she showed no sign of nerves to add the parallel giant slalom title to her growing collection exactly a week later - becoming the first woman to claim gold medals in two sports at a Winter Olympics.
"I thought there must be some mistake, I thought they'd switch the times for someone else's!" Ledecka said after her skiing triumph.
She didn't even own the skis on which she raced - her equipment borrowed from giant slalom gold medallist Mikaela Shiffrin.
But no such inexperience was on show seven days later as she defeated Germany's Selina Joerg to win her second gold of the Games.
It's like being great at badminton and tennis. While the theory is the same, the strategy and technique are polar opposites

Full schedule and results
Shock skiing success
In the super G, Ledecka denied defending champion Anna Veith what seemed a certain successive gold by just one hundredth of a second, with the Austrian having already started to give celebratory interviews.
But not only did she deprive Veith of that much-desired second gold, her result pushed back two-time Olympic medallist Lindsey Vonn into sixth, after the American - competing at her first Olympics since 2010 - made a costly mistake.
No-one could have predicted the path the race would take, with BBC commentator Matt Chilton describing Ledecka's victory as "one of the most astonishing Olympic stories of all time".
But it was perhaps Vonn who summed it up best, saying: "I wish I had as much athleticism as she has to hop from sport to sport and win everything.
"Unfortunately I'm only good at ski racing and she still beat me!"
Already a star in snowboarding
Ester Ledecka
Multi-talented: Ledecka in action on her way to her second gold medal of the Games
Ledecka only started on the skiing circuit in 2016 with her super G World Cup best just 19th - coming in Garmisch-Partenkirchen and Lake Louise last season - but snowboarding is where it's truly at for her.
As the world champion and with five World Cup titles to her name this season, the parallel giant slalom is the only event in which you'd have expected heavy-favourite Ledecka to be winning gold prior to the start of the Games.
Even silver medallist Veith - whose fairytale return from injury was dashed at the very end by Ledecka - wasn't aware of her skiing abilities, admitting she didn't know "how strong" the Czech was.
Ledecka became a double junior world champion in the parallel slalom and parallel giant slalom in 2013 while still at high school, before making her Olympic debut in Sochi the following year.
It was 2015, however, when the world really took notice as she was crowned parallel slalom world champion for the first time, before adding the parallel giant slalom title to her haul in 2017.
But 2018 has been her best year yet.Asked whether her snowboarding prowess helped her before her gold-medal run on skis, she said: "I took confidence from snowboarding.
"I was standing at the start and I said to myself, 'This is my dream, at the last Olympics you were here on just a snowboard, now you're here on skis, so go do your best run'.
"From skiing for snowboard, I take the fast speed, I'm not afraid of the speed. I just focus on riding downhill, that's all. Every time.
"I've just got on with it since I was a little child and throughout my career I've had luck in meeting good people, and I have a great team. They're very supportive and professional and maybe that's why I'm up here right now."

History accomplished
Way before her second gold medal-winning run, Ledecka had already made history in qualification, becoming the first athlete to compete in both snowboard and skiing at the Olympics.
But in climbing to the top step of the podium yet again, she has elevated the scale of her feat to another level entirely.
She is the fifth athlete to win in two sports at one Games and the first in unrelated events, with the previous double wins coming in Nordic events.
"Today was a big day for snowboard Ester!" she said after winning her second gold.
"Today was something very special - I'll think about this moment until the end of my life."
But the Ledecka family are no strangers to success at the Olympics - her grandfather Jan Klapac won bronze at the 1964 Games in Innsbruck before winning silver four years later in Grenoble for the then-Czechoslovakia ice hockey team.
Ester's Pyeongchang gold medals completes the set for the Ledeckas but, at just 22 years old, you sense there is plenty more to come.

'An astonishing achievement' - analysis
Ski Sunday commentator Ed Leigh: "It's like being great at badminton and tennis. While the theory is the same, the strategy and technique are polar opposites.
"It's not like Ester grew up just doing alpine, she has always done both codes and has somehow perfected both sports.
"Her achievement in the super G was astonishing."
BBC Sport skiing expert Graham Bell: "It's probably the best story of these Games. It's hard enough doing one discipline in alpine skiing.
"What Ester does is she trains three weeks alpine skiing then three weeks snowboarding. She has done that her entire career.
"She didn't want to give either up because she loved it so much. It is a massive shock because she has never even placed on a World Cup podium. To do two completely different sports is incredible."

Rutten says McGregors meteoric rise to fame and fortune has happened so quickly it can be hard to adjust to the sudden change in his life. Its a situation he says he would have struggled with during his heyday, too.
He did so much good for MMA, he continued.
He just needs to find his way in this world. This guy was pretty much unknown four years ago, now hes one of the most known guys on the planet. Thats a hard thing to deal with. I dont know if I could have done it.
I always try to put myself in their shoes. Me with that kind of money at that age? I dont know what would have happened to me. Im a smart guy now - I would think that I would keep that money. But at 28? I dont know, man. I was just a completely different animal.
I hope they give him a pass, dont spit him out yet. Let him see if he cleans up.

Rutten also spoke about the possibility of McGregor returning to fight for the UFC lightweight title later in the year against newly-crowned world champion Khabib Nurmagomedov.
Its a classic striker versus grappler matchup, with McGregors slick striking contrasting with Russian Nurmagomedovs dominant wrestling and heavy-handed ground and pound. Its a matchup that Rutten says would offer a huge test of the Irishmans all-round MMA skills.
I go back to Chad Mendes (versus McGregor at UFC 189), he said.
Chad had 12 days to train and he put him on his back immediately. And he (McGregor) had a problem off his back.
Khabib is a guy that is not going to run out of gas. Hell have a full training camp, hes gonna be on him. Now, dont get me wrong, Khabibs never been knocked out or nothing, but Conor can hit. He can really hit.
If he really uses footwork he can land his shot and hopefully capitalise on that. But I think once it goes to the ground, a guy like Khabib is just very hard to get off you.
This is not about just hold.
A post shared by Khabib Nurmagomedov (@khabib_nurmagomedov) on Mar 15, 2018 at 12:57am PDT
INSTAGRAM
The general consensus is that McGregor would hold a significant striking advantage while the fight is on the feet, but Nurmagomedov could dominate proceedings with his wrestling if he can close the distance and get his hands on the Dubliner.
And avoiding Nurmagomedovs takedowns is an aspect of McGregors game that Rutten says hell have to work hard to improve ahead of any potential bout with the undefeated Russian.
He knows its his Achilles heel, so he needs to work on that, he said of McGregors wrestling.
I was pretty much the same as Conor. I was great striker, but I sucked at takedown defence. So I dont know, its a hard one.
Its a punchers chance. He uses a lot of footwork and he can tag him and actually knock him out. Conor can do it, but can he knock him out? Thats the question. Otherwise, its gonna be one of those fights.
Hes gonna have to work angles. But 25 minutes of fight time? Its a long time to avoid a takedown.

UFC women's bantamweight champion Amanda 'The Lioness' Nunes continued her reign with a fifth-round stoppage of American Raquel Pennington on Saturday night.
Nunes's victory was her third successive title defence, and her seventh-straight victory, as she underlined her status as one of the most dominant forces in women's MMA.

The bout made history as the first world title fight between two openly gay fighters in UFC history. And the two combatants battled it out for five rounds before Nunes eventually claimed the TKO stoppage in front of a home crowd in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
But the finish to the main event at UFC 224 left a sour taste, as Pennington was sent out to continue in the fifth and final round after clearly trying to quit on her stool at the end of the fourth round.

"I'm done," she told her team, who nonetheless talked her into going out for the final round. She was then taken down and finished mid-way through the final round by the dominant world champion.
Many took to Twitter to express their disbelief.
Think about how insanely confident fighters are.
Think about how crazy it can sound when they profess their strengths.
They're the most confident people I've ever met.
For a fighter to say they don't want it anymore is the hardest thing for them to admit.

After taking the win with scores of 29-28, 28-29, 29-28, Gastelum thanked the Brazilian crowd in their native tongue before staking his claim for the next shot at the undisputed middleweight world title.
Hopefully Im in line next for that title, he said.
If not, I'm ready for anybody. But I feel like the winner of this fight should fight the winner of Yoel (Romero) and Robert (Whittaker) later on this year, preferably in Madison Square (Garden).
Machida serves up Knockout of the Year contender
One of Lyoto Machida's most memorable moments came back in 2011 when he spectacularly knocked out UFC legend Randy Couture with a Karate Kid-style front kick at UFC 129.
And 'The Dragon' repeated the feat in stunning style as he knocked out fellow former light-heavyweight champion Vitor Belfort at UFC 224.
The knockout came at the 60-second mark in the second round, and afterwards, Machida paid tribute to his opponent.
"I have a lot of respect for Vitor Belfort, he's done a lot for this sport," he said.
"I was looking for the right moment. All I need is one strike to end the fight."
And Machida ended his night by calling out Britain's former UFC middleweight champion.
"Michael Bisping. I'm still waiting for you, man! I want to do this fight. If you're not retired, you've gotta fight me first!"
And with the Rio crowd chanting his name, fellow UFC legend Belfort officially announced his retirement from the UFC as he laid his gloves down inside the octagon and left the cage for the final time.

He comes with the nickname the 'Nigerian Nightmare' but number seven-ranked UFC welterweight, Kamaru Usman, faced his own bad dream last month when his upcoming bout with Santiago Ponzinibbio was cancelled.
Usman was due to take on the fighter at the UFC's first ever event in Chile, but when the Argentine was forced to withdraw because of injury, a new opponent had to be found. 
Now Usman will face Demian Maia for Sunday's Fight Night event, and despite his new adversary being widely recognised as one of the most skilled jiu-jitsu fighters in the UFC, Usman isn't concerned. 
The BBC MMA Show spoke with Usman ahead of his fight on 20 May, and he seemed unfazed by the late change. 
Its a minor adjustment, Usman said.
INSTAGRAM
If I have a fight, I like to have ample time to work on what I need to do for that fight but Im a mixed martial artist, so I should be able to adapt to each and every person. Its what we work on in our gym. Whether its a big, tall, fat or small fighter, it doesnt matter because opponents do change.
Its taken nearly two years for Usman to get a shot at Maia, having initially called him out in 2016, but hell finally get his chance this Sunday against what he describes as the most dangerous submission specialist in mixed-martial-arts".
I knew I had what it took to get the job done two years ago, which is why I called him out, Usman added.
INSTAGRAM
This is a business trip for me. Ive come here to do a job and thats what Im going to do. I dont care about the distractions along the way. Im just focused and all in.
INSTAGRAM
From the years of me working on my craft, whether it was wrestling in high school or college, I consider myself classically trained to where you keep your mouth closed and do the work. And once you realise your ability, then you can be vocal about it.
Once I get the job done on Saturday, it should be a statement that Im next in line for that title shot.
INSTAGRAM
Tyron Woodley is the current champion of the welterweight division, although he hasnt fought in nearly a year, so a match-up with a fresh contender is due.
I like Woodley, but I have a goal and thats to be the welterweight champion and he has that belt, so I thats the guy that I want.
Usman also isnt ignoring the other talented opponents in his division, which includes Liverpools Darren Till, who will of course take on number-one-ranked welterweight contender Stephen Thompson at UFC Liverpool on 27 May.
INSTAGRAM
Thatll be a great fight, Usman predicts. Darren Tills a big boy but I just feel that Thompson has a little more in his toolbox to get it done, so Ill give Thompson the edge in whatll be an entertaining fight."
The winner of that fight could determine who Usman will face in the future
I believe after this fight, theres only two or three guys that make sense to fight for the title, Usman claims. And one of them will be the winner of Stephen Thompson v Darren Till.

UFC Liverpool: 'Im going into enemy territory - everybodys going to be booing me'
Britain's Korahn Gayle says he hopes the Street League Skateboarding (SLS) coming to London will inspire people to try the sport.
The Copper Box will host the world's most prestigious skateboarding competition on Saturday and Sunday and it will be broadcast live on the BBC.
Skateboarding will make its Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020.
American Nyjah Huston and Australia's Shane O'Neill are among the big names competing in London.
"It is definitely a privilege to be involved," said 30-year-old pro-skater Gayle. "It is great it is in London and a lot of people will be inspired to go buy a skateboard."
Bristolian Gayle, who started skating when he was 12 and turned professional aged 21, added: "It would be great to get more people into skating - younger and older.
"It is a creative and positive thing to do, with a great community and good way of keeping active."
The athletes will compete in a custom-built concrete skate plaza.
"SLS is proud to inspire the next generation with this historic showcase of the world's best street skateboarders at the Copper Box in May, and we are honoured to serve the established skate community that has been a revered influence and inspiration to our skaters and fans for decades," said SLS general manager Kaitlyn Banchero.
Lucy Adams, chair of Skateboard England added: "It's a fantastic opportunity to raise the profile of skateboarding in the UK and will help to increase participation across the country as we see the world's top street skateboarders competing here."

Reigning champions Golden State Warriors are on the brink of missing out on the NBA Finals following a 98-94 defeat by the Houston Rockets.
The Rockets, who led the league with 65 regular-season wins from 82 games, now have a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Western Conference series.
However, despite losing, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said: "I feel great about where we are right now.
"That may sound crazy but I feel it. I know what I'm seeing out there."

The Rockets have not reached the Finals since they managed it on successive occasions in in 1994 and 1995.
James Harden, their key player, said: "For us nothing changes.
"We take it game by game, position by position, try to compete our butts off and give ourselves the best chance."
Golden State host game six on Saturday.
The winner of the series will face either the Cleveland Cavaliers or Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals starting on 31 May. The Celtics currently lead the Cavaliers 3-2 in the Eastern Conference finals.
The Cavs and the Warriors have met in each of the three previous NBA Finals, with Golden State winning twice.
Nearly one in three British Olympic and Paralympic athletes have experienced or witnessed "unacceptable behaviour" in their elite programme, according to a UK Sport report.
The 'Culture Health Check' report was commissioned after a series of athlete welfare and bullying scandals.
More than 90% of athletes and staff said they were proud to be part of their programmes.
Yet there were concerns over giving feedback and mental health support.
Almost a third of athletes (31%) disagreed they had "opportunities to give feedback without fear of negative consequences" in their world-class programme.
One in six athletes said they had experienced "unacceptable behaviour", with a similar number saying they had witnessed it, but only 24% reported it to their national governing body.
Nearly a quarter (24%) said they were dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the "measures taken in their sport to optimise the mental health" of high-performance athletes.
All sports were invited to take part in the review, with 682 athletes responding out of 895 asked.
UK Sport said the results are "largely encouraging" but acknowledged "some clear areas for improvement" with a need to "enhance feedback", "address unacceptable behaviour" and "understand more about mental health".
"The findings prove that the majority of the high-performance system is working brilliantly well, is valued by the athletes and staff and is enabling them to achieve amazing things in very challenging circumstances," UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl told BBC Sport.
"But every issue raised in a report like this is very serious and every sport will develop an action plan to address its specific issues.
"We need to create a system where the quality of the discussion is improved and the athlete's feedback is as valued as the coach's advice and support."
Several British sporting governing bodies have been embroiled in controversy around duty of care standards, including cycling, gymnastics, taekwondo, Para-swimming and Para-snowsport.
In February, the BBC revealed a quarter of Britain's leading Para-athletessaid they did not feel cared about as a person.
In response to Thursday's report, UK Sport announced a new range of initiatives aimed at improving athlete welfare.
The agency will double its funding of the independent British Athletes' Commission (BAC) to £1m before the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics.
"There should be routes for athletes to voice their concerns and be heard, ideally within the sport, so that concerns can be dealt with early doors," added Nicholl.
"But failing that, an athlete needs an effective and supportive BAC that they can turn to for independent support and help."
UK Sport says its increased funding for the BAC will allow the organisation to have a casework officer in the north and south of the country, and provide continuous support rather than just responding to incidents.
A series of roadshows are also being staged around the country, linking up current and former athletes with careers advice and workshops.
The report also found there have been improvements in whistleblowing and reporting procedures, plus more support around mental and physical health issues.
Ian Braid, the managing director of the independent advisory organisation Duty Of Care In Action sport (DOCIAsport) and former head of the BAC, said he was "pleased" about the funding increase.
"However, the key recommendation in Baroness Grey-Thompson's duty of care review for the government, which stated that the BAC should be independently-funded, has been ignored.
"This is a shame as that would have given athletes more confidence in the system and that genuine grievances would be properly investigated and disclosed."
Analysis
BBC sports editor Dan Roan
This could serve as a wake-up call for British sport. The survey paints a mixed picture of the Olympic and Paralympic landscape.
On the one hand, nine out of 10 respondents answered positively about the quality of support they receive, and the pride they feel representing their country.
But after a spate of bullying scandals in a variety of publicly funded sports over the past year, it is also alarming to learn that so many athletes have experienced unacceptable behaviour, and clearly fear being deselected if they speak out about it.
UK Sport says the fact they were prepared to conduct such a study proves they are addressing the problem and the additional funding for the British Athletes' Commission will be welcomed by many.
But some critics would have liked to see the establishment of an independent sport ombudsman to rule on disputes, and greater rights for athletes in the contracts they have to sign in return for funding.
Meanwhile, debate will continue over whether British sport is any different from other walks of life when it comes to duty of care, or if the 'no-compromise' approach to the pursuit of medals is to blame for failings.
The London 2012 Olympics would not have happened without Dame Tessa Jowell, says Lord Coe.
Dame Tessa, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2017, died on Saturday aged 70 following a haemorrhage.
As culture secretary she played a major part in bidding for and organising the Olympic Games.
"There was nobody you would rather have in your corner. Without her the sporting landscape of the UK would have looked very different," said Lord Coe.
"Quite simply, without Tessa there would have been no London 2012, and without Tessa they would not have been the success they were.
"No politician deserves greater credit for the Games. She showed unflinching tenacity."
Obituary: Dame Tessa Jowell
Dame Tessa won support from the Labour cabinet to name London as a candidate to host the Games. She was later made Minister for the Olympics.
London were awarded the Olympics and Paralympics on 6 July 2005 and went on to host an event that Coe said "lit up the world".
'She believed in sport for social change'
Sir Hugh Robertson, chairman of the British Olympic Association, said Olympic sport had lost "a very great friend".
"She absolutely believed in sport as an agent for social change - as a means for bettering people's lives and for the good it could do for people," he told BBC Radio 5 live's Sportsweek.
"London 2012 simply wouldn't have happened without her. She couldn't have done more to deliver it."
Great Britain's Greg Rutherford won long jump gold at London 2012
Dame Katherine Grainger, the chair of UK Sport, described Dame Tessa as a "much respected and loved figure within British sport".
"Tessa was a true believer in the power and inspiration of sport, for which all of us who benefited from her support and conviction will be eternally grateful," said Grainger, who won rowing gold for Great Britain at London 2012.
'We got lost in a golf buggy'
BBC sports news correspondent Richard Conway
On the opening day of the 2012 Olympics I was working as a producer for BBC Breakfast.
I had to pick Tessa up in a golf buggy very early and bring her to the live location. Only I got lost, with her on board, in the unfamiliar new park.
So there we are - me and the former Olympics Minister - going in circles at 6am in an empty park as I tried desperately to remember the way.
Some politicians would get angry. Instead she laughed, saw the funny side.
"We'll get there," she said. And we did. Eventually.
Former FBI director James Comey is among the tallest men in the United States at 6ft 8in (2m) tall.
Only one in 30,000 men in the United States can stand eye-to-eye or higher
But could Mr Comey - or any other very tall man come to that - have counted on their height alone to have a career in the US professional basketball league, the NBA?
"I'd calculate that someone who is 6'8" has about a one-in-200 chance of reaching the NBA," says Seth Stephens-Davidowitz, a data scientist from New York.
He has compared estimates of the populations of Americans at various heights with the recorded heights of NBA basketball players.
Image copyrightGETTY IMAGESImage captionAnthony Davis of the New Orleans Pelicans goes up for a shot during the 2018 Western Conference semi-finals
"A man who's under six feet tall has around a one-in-one million chance of reaching the NBA," he adds. "A man who is over seven feet tall has about a one-in-seven chance."
Sports writer Sam Smith, who covered Michael Jordan's golden years at the Chicago Bulls, explains why coaches might pick someone for their height alone.
"The simplistic notion is that the taller you are, the closer you are to the basket, and the easier it is to score," he said.
"This has led to the cliché 'you can't teach height'. You can get better in shooting, you can get better in dribbling, but you can't get better in size."
So could a young Mr Comey have been spotted for his height alone and then coached into becoming a basketball great?
Well, talent-spotting primarily based on people's height has produced some amazing results.
Players such as Tim Duncan, Hakeem Olajuwon and Dirk Nowitzki didn't start playing basketball until their late teens. They were talent-spotted because they were tall and then went on to become greats of the game.
The tallest players to play in the NBA were Gheorghe Mure?an and Manute Bol, who were each 7 ft 7 in tall.
But Mr Smith says team coaches can get a little too carried away with this height obsession. For every tall man who makes the breakthrough, there are probably hundreds of others brought into teams who ultimately amount to nothing.
What about the social aspect? Don't most basketball players come from tough backgrounds, turning to basketball as a route out of poverty?

Luol Deng: NBA star on GB, Miami and life as a refugee
According to Mr Stephens-Davidowitz, the data is clear. "Actually, the better your childhood background the higher your chances of reaching the NBA," he explained.
"You're more likely to reach the NBA if you came from a two-parent home rather than a single parent home. if your parents had you when they were older rather than when they were teenagers and if your parents were middle-class or upper-middle-class than if they were poor."
Mr Comey grew up in the well-to-do town of Allendale, located in one of the most wealthy counties in the United States, so he's got an advantage here.
Image copyrightGETTY IMAGESImage captionKevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers shoots the ball against Greg Monroe of the Boston Celtics
But why does social class have such an influence over sporting success?
"One advantage is actually in giving height. It's been shown that kids from better backgrounds reach greater adult heights and this is due to better nutrition and better healthcare in childhood," says Mr Stephens-Davidowitz.
"The other factor is building what economists call non-cognitive skills. One of the biggest advantages of a good background is building skills like trust, perseverance, discipline and ability to get along well with others."

A quarter of current NBA players are from outside the USA.
Mr Stephens-Davidowitz believes that the reason foreigners have made such an impression on the competition is because much of the rest of the world has caught up with the United States in terms of medical care and nutrition.
"There are an increasing number of people from around the world, from Africa and Asia as well, who are of great, great adult height. These other countries are now producing more seven-footers and a good fraction of them are talented enough to reach the NBA."

The dominant NBA team in recent seasons has been the Golden State Warriors, led by Steph Curry.
A specialist long-range shooter, he's only 6 ft 3in, considerably shorter than Mr Comey and many of the giants who have dominated the game in the past.
Curry's success, says Mr Smith, has got teams looking in a new direction, away from the big men.

"Sport is often copycat. When somebody succeeds, everyone tries to do the same thing. In the 1980s everyone thought you had to have a 6 ft 9in point guard because Magic Johnson was the dominant player," he says.
But the recent expansion in mathematical study of the game means there's less emphasis on size and more on long-distance shooting.
"When I was growing up in the 1960s, if you were 6 ft 8 in, you were probably going to make the team," says Mr Smith.
"Now if you're 6 ft 8 in, you probably have a better chance of a career in the FBI than you do in basketball."
Unfortunately for James Comey, he has neither.
The Boston Celtics will face LeBron James' Cleveland Cavaliers in the NBA Eastern Conference finals after a 4-1 series win over the Philadelphia 76ers.
Jayson Tatum put Boston 111-109 ahead with 22 seconds left, before three free throws earned them a 114-112 victory.
"We've got a lot of heart and a lot of talent on this team, nobody expected us to get this far," said Tatum.

Sport continues to build bridges in North and South Korea, almost three months since the so-called 'Peace Olympics' were held in the South.
Just days after leaders of the two countries pledged to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons, the two nations have unified in the table tennis hall - rather than compete against each other amid a backdrop of inter-Korean reconciliation.
The two countries - who are technically still at war - were due to meet in the quarter-finals of the World Team Table Tennis Championships in Halmstad, Sweden but decided to instead lay down their bats and shake hands in order to form a unified team.
Incredibly - and perhaps for the first time in sporting competition - the tournament's organisers agreed the two teams could merge, and they will now face either Japan or Ukraine in the final four on Friday.
It is not, however, the first time the two nations have competed as one. In February, they fielded a unified women's ice hockey team at the Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
Referring to Thursday's sporting move, International Table Tennis Federation president Thomas Weikert said: "When I informed the board of directors about this development, the unified team received a standing ovation from the delegates who showed their sign of support for this historic move."
It follows the significant meeting between the North's leader Kim Jong-un and South Korea's Moon Jae-in last week where the leaders agreed to work towards "lasting peace".
LeBron James scored 45 points to lead the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 105-101 win over the Indiana Pacers and into the second round of the NBA play-offs.

But he produced his third 40-point game of the series as Cleveland wrapped up the best-of-seven Eastern Conference series 4-3.
It earned them a second-round meeting with East top seeds Toronto Raptors.
The Pacers had ensured a tense deciding contest with a comprehensive 121-87 victory in game six on Friday.
But James made his first seven shots of the finale and finished the first half with 26 points, five assists and four rebounds.
He also became the first player to score 20 or more points 200 times in the play-offs and surpassed the record of Chicago Bulls great Scottie Pippen for most career post-season steals.
The Cavs have defeated the Raptors, who beat the Washington Wizards in round one, in both of the past two play-offs, including a 4-0 sweep in the 2017 Eastern Conference semi-finals.

Yes, you read that headline correctly. Cheerleading should be included at the Olympic Games.
Before you scoff and compare what you think "cheerleading" is to the age-old Olympic disciplines of athletics, swimming and rowing, we urge you to continue reading.
Women shouting "Give-me-an-A" and waving pom-poms this ain't.
Competitive or All-Star cheerleading is one of the most high-risk, adrenaline-inducing sports around.
The International Cheerleading Union (ICU) World Championship finals took place at Walt Disney World in Orlando on Friday and England's co-ed (men and women) elite squad are the new world champions.
Co-ed squads feature both men and women
Scotland, Ireland and Wales all sent teams too.
What is "all-star" cheerleading?
This is a million miles from the 'sideline' cheerleading you'd typically see during half-time at American football or basketball matches.
Teams (of up to 35 athletes  both co-ed and all-girl divisions feature) are judged on stunts, pyramids, tumbles, jumps and dance during an exhilarating and lung-busting two-and-a-half-minute routine.
The judging system is similar to that of diving, synchronised swimming and gymnastics.
Here is our three-point argument for why cheerleading should be seriously considered for the Olympic roster come Los Angeles 2028.
1. It's that sport you never knew you loved
We all become obsessed with watching new, obscure sports during the Olympics. Curling, fencing, dancing horses... there's always at least one.
Not only is cheerleading exciting, noisy and slightly terrifying to watch live in the arena, it is also utterly captivating to watch on the small screen.
Team England had the chance to show-off their skills at Disney's All-Star Sports Field - an iconic venue in the world of cheerleading
Slow-motion replays of gravity-defying stunts? Yes please.
Watching some of the most highly-skilled young athletes working together like a well-oiled machine to produce a meticulously executed routine? Absolutely.
The high-risk factor makes it all the more enthralling for the viewer too.
It is not uncommon for a flyer (the athlete literally thrown into the air) to fall during a stunt. But don't worry - one of the first things you are taught is how to fall and catch in the safest way possible.
2. It will not be a one-horse race
As the current incarnation of cheerleading originated in North America, it seems fitting that the first Olympic medals would be contested in its 'homeland'.
But there are many countries who will happily and convincingly challenge the prospective favourites, Team USA, for the inaugural title.
Team USA have dominated, but the gap is narrowing every year - the Eagles were beaten in the all-girl Premier division by Finland this year
At this week's World Championships, teams from Mexico, Norway, New Zealand and Chile all claimed podium finishes.
Team England have historically been fierce competitors too. They have earned medals at the last three World Championships - no mean feat.
And other powerhouse cheer nations such as Japan, Canada and China have delivered stunningly creative and complex routines at the top level.
It may also surprise you that Team Finland have the potential to shock - they caused a huge upset in the hotly-contested all-girl Premier division this year by beating Team USA to the gold.
It has all the ingredients for a very exciting competition.
3. It will (finally) give cheerleading the kudos it deserves
Cheerleaders everywhere have been arguing with sceptics for years about its credibility - mainly about its status as a sport.
But if you were to look up the dictionary definition of "sport", it ticks every box.
"An activity involving physical exertion and skill in which an individual or team competes against another or others for entertainment."
Gold medallists also receive a coveted World Champion ring
These athletes train just as hard as gymnasts, for just as many hours as a synchronised swim team, and compete as often as volleyball teams.
In 2019, three years after being granted provisional Olympic status by the IOC, cheerleading will be able to apply to become part of the full Olympic Games sports programme.
So LA 2028 is not beyond the realms of possibility.
"Cheerleading is a sport with growing popularity. It has a strong youth focus and we noted that," IOC sports director Kit McConnell said.
The ICU has more than 100 national federations and almost 4.5 million registered athletes.
At the highest level, cheerleading is a visual treat, hugely competitive and its athletes are passionate - nay - obsessed with their sport.
We rest our case.
Former Korean Basketball League player David Simon had to head back to the US
After South Korea's basketball league kicked out a foreign player for being too tall, news reports have since emerged of athletes desperately trying to shrink themselves.
A new height limit imposed on the sport has drawn both controversy and ridicule for its attempt to cut foreigners down to size.
What exactly happened?
The Korean Basketball League (KBL) recently angered fans when it announced a significant change in the rules.
Each team in South Korea can have only two foreign players. Starting with the 2018-19 season, one of these players must not be taller than 200cm (6ft 6in), while the other one cannot be taller than 186cm.
This meant that one of the country's most popular foreign players - an American called David Simon - had to leave. At 202.1cm, he had missed the cut-off by just millimetres.
"I was a little upset," Mr Simon recently told the BBC World Service's OS programme.
"Just to be that close and not be able to make it, kind of stinks. Doesn't look like I'll be going back there to play unless they change the rule again."
Simon, who had topped the KBL in the previous basketball season, had to head home to the US, much to fans' chagrin. A petition was filed to the South Korean presidential office to abolish the KBL's height rules, and bring back Simon, reported Yonhap news.
Fans then took to social media to bid farewell to departing players.

Why has South Korea done this?
It's not the first time this has happened. In fact, Korea has had a height limit for foreign players since 1997, but this is the shortest that has ever imposed.
The KBL has maintained that it has to protect local players who, on average, cannot match the heights of foreign players, mostly Americans.
Image copyrightGETTY IMAGESImage captionAthletes like Charles Rhodes have made the cut in South Korea, but not others
The league has also said the height limit will lead to better games with higher scores and a faster pace.
"We believe this new height restriction will revive the popularity of pro basketball in the country," KBL Secretary General Lee Sung-han told Yonhap.
Is South Korea alone in this?
The lack of extremely tall local players appears to be particularly acute in Asia, where for every Yao Ming (229cm) there are many more players of average height.
It's one reason why the basketball league in the Philippines has had for decades a 200cm height limit for foreign players, as "permitting American 7-footers to play would wreak havoc", reported Slate magazine.
The debate has long overshadowed the sport. Way back in 1957, Sports Illustrated magazine ran a discussion with both proponents and opponents arguing that either way, a height limit was discriminatory.
Image copyrightAFPImage captionChinese player Yao Ming is 229cm and a star in the US
"There are advantages and disadvantages both to being taller and shorter," Donyell Marshall, the men's head coach of basketball at Central Connecticut State University's Blue Devil Athletics, told the BBC.
"If you're taller you can score around the rim better, you can block shots and you can rebound. But smaller players can usually shoot better. They are faster and better dribblers."
So how do you shrink a basketball player?
It's a shadowy science. Yonhap reported that the South Korean teams tried lifting weights and jogging before measurement, hoping that dehydration could knock off a few centimetres.
In the 1970s and 1980s, when bouffant hairstyles were popular, Philippine teams would shave their foreign players' heads to battle height restrictions, reported Slate. Other methods employed over the years include doing shoulder presses and squats, with the idea that this could compress their bones.
If all else failed, some resorted to cheating - slouching, bending their knees ever so slightly, or leaning against the wall during measurement. But officials soon cottoned on - and simply measured the athletes while they lay flat on the ground.

Doctors say it's almost impossible to shrink your body.
First of all, there hasn't been much of a market for shrinkage, so there's hardly been any medical innovations.
"It's actually very rare... usually people want to grow taller and the technology has been there for that," says Dr Tan Chyn Hong, an orthopaedic surgeon and a former Singapore national athlete.
"If you want to lose a lot, there is no reasonable way to do that - short of chopping your bones."
But not all hope is lost.
"Non-surgically, there are things you can do to a very small degree," says Dr Tan.
"The discs in your spine are composed of water amongst other things, so for example, if you dehydrate yourself, you could perhaps lose a bit of height from the shrinking of the accumulated discs.
"I would say from doing that, and maybe also slouching a bit, it's possible to lose 1cm - but any more than that is very tough."

North Korea willing to talk 'at any time'

Players, like England's Andy Sullivan, were encouraged to interact with fans during the inaugural tournament
Golf has gained "six-appeal" and taken a significant step towards finding a marketable short form of the game.
The European Tour's Golf Sixes, staged at the Centurion Club near St Albans, proved popular with players and fans and established itself as the blueprint for the sport's version of cricket's Twenty20 format.
Introducing the use of a shot clock on one of the holes is an idea that could swiftly be incorporated in existing long-form tournaments.
But this inaugural event also proved meaningful golf matches can be played over as few as six holes. They can be done and dusted in little over an hour and a decent tournament can be completed in a weekend.
Scotland claim third place at inaugural event
Golf has been 'asleep at the wheel'
This is just what golf needs with the current perception that it is increasingly losing out because it takes too long to play and watch.
Traditional professional golf becomes genuinely absorbing "down the stretch." Golf Sixes catapults us straight to that point with no preamble.
Every shot counts, making the importance of a good start paramount, but there remains the opportunity for dramatic fight-backs. This is a formula that serves so well cricket's IPL and Big Bash matches.

For spectators, there was plenty to watch and hear. Some of the stuff pumped through the microphones and speakers missed the mark but an engaging atmosphere was generated.
To make it work better they should employ announcers who know their subject and are capable of identifying all of the players and match situations.
Celebrity TV coverage
Further gimmicks are not required, nor do we need our intelligence insulted when mediocre putts are described as "great".
Likewise, the celebrity aspect of the television coverage grated somewhat and we did not need to be constantly told of the tournament's success in such sycophantic terms.
We could see for ourselves that it was worth watching.
It could have been bettered if the players wore microphones - listening to tactical discussions would have enhanced the coverage and the greensomes matchplay alternate shot format was a good choice.

Denmark won the tournament with a final win over Australia
But the most significant development was the shot clock used on the fourth hole. "I think it's a great idea," said England's Andy Sullivan.
During the first day of round-robin group matches, players were allowed 40 seconds to execute their strokes. That was reduced to 30 for the second day of knockout matches.
"What we found is when we're hitting, we had such a long time," Sullivan added. "You've got ages, and it's embarrassing when you are playing on the Tour and it is taking that long.
"I think that's highlighted a lot of things, really, for the Tour."
Paul Peterson, of the United States, fell foul of the shot clock on the first day and it cost the Americans a quarter-final place. "He's probably humiliated," said Chris Wood, Sullivan's England team-mate.
"I think that's quite a lot to do with it, the naming and shaming. Sully is right, there's too much leniency I think.
"Players are to blame; hold your hands up there, but referees can be stronger on occasion."
Slow play is the enemy
European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley has identified slow play as golf's biggest enemy. It would be a surprise if he is not considering proposing wider use of shot clocks.
He will also be wondering where next to take the Golf Sixes concept.
"I think it is definitely answering the cry from the global world of golf to be innovative and not be afraid of change," Pelley told BBC Sport.

"There needs to be another way to attract the younger generation. Is this the answer? Maybe, and we will take what is good out of this and build on it."
The Tour will examine player feedback - some felt the knockout matches should have lasted nine holes - and marketing data before deciding their next move.
"It will definitely be back next year," Pelley announced at the closing ceremony.
Certainly it feels as though his Tour has arrived on a concept that can complement the existing diet of predominantly 72 holes strokeplay.
It would work well under floodlights in big city venues where it is easier to attract big crowds. They are vital to generating an atmosphere commensurate with the excitement of the golf.
The inaugural tournament ended with Denmark winning the final against Australia on the closing green. Scotland came third, triumphing by inches in a nearest the pin shootout against England's quarter-final conquerors, Italy.
It was a fitting climax to a weekend that lays down a very encouraging and exciting marker for the future development of the game. Iain Carter column: Has golf lost ground over driving distances?
British Wheelchair Racing Championships, Stoke Mandeville, 6-7 May
Hannah Cockroft (Jenni Banks) enjoyed a successful weekend at the British championships, clocking her third quickest time ever over 400m with a 59.02 clocking. This added to a 17.40 (+1.0) time in the 100m to take the win, 31.14 in the 200m and 59.02 in the 400m.
Triple Paralympic medallist Kare Adenegan (Job King) took a break from her exam studies to revise two personal bests; she recorded times of 17.97 (1.0) in the 100m, the first time she has ever dipped under 18 seconds, and 60.94 in the 400m ? an improvement of 0.73 seconds.
Jade Jones (Ian Thompson/Tanni Grey-Thompson) was in record breaking form over the weekend, as she set a lifetime best over 10,000m with a 24.15 performance. Her time would have been a world record had it not been in a mixed race.
Richard Chiassaro (Jenni Banks) was in fine form on the track winning several titles across the weekend as well as coaching number of young athletes at their first ever British championships. The Harlow athlete took almost four seconds off his best in the 1500m, recoding a solo effort of 3:02.49. He wasn?t finished there either; times of 25.87 (200m), 47.19 (400m) and 1:34.04 (800m) saw him add to his successes over the two days.
Paralympic T33 100m silver medallist Toby Gold (Jenni Banks) lowered his lifetime best over the distance, winning in 17.16 (1.5) with bronze medallist Andrew Small (Rick Hoskins) continuing his solid start to the season with an 18.27 clocking. Elsewhere, Nathan Maguire (Steven Hoskins) was in great form, improving his 100m personal best to 14.77 (1.3).
After a couple of weeks of illness, Stephen Miller (Ros Miller) returned to the club throw and threw a best of 29.43m in the second round. In the women?s equivalent, Paralympic bronze medallist Gemma Prescott (Mike Wood) began her 2017 campaign with a best of 20.76m.

Payton Jordan Invitational, California, USA, 5 May
Rosie Clarke (coach: David Harmer) was perhaps the pick on the many British endurance runners out in California, as she revised her 3000m steeplechase personal best by 15 seconds to take a thrilling victory in 9.36.75, well inside the London 2017 World Championship qualifying standard.
In the women?s 5,000m Eilish McColgan (Liz McColgan) was fifth with a 15.22.12 run, whilst Charlotte Taylor was 13th in a personal best of 15.29.07. In the second section there were personal bests for Melissa Courtney (Rob Denmark) and Lauren Howarth (Steve Vernon) as they were fourth and fifth in 15.28.95 and 15.29.26 respectively. For Courtney that was a 45 seconds improvement on her previous best.
In the 10,000m Alice Wright (Joe Franklin) broke the University of New Mexico record with a 32.29.29 personal best, whilst Rio 2016 Olympian Sonia Samuels was agonisingly less than two seconds outside her personal best for the distance with a 32.41.19 performance.
In the men?s race Andy Vernon (Nic Bideau) dipped inside 28 minutes with a 27.58.69 time, good for ninth, whilst there were personal bests for Marc Scott (Steve Gulley) and Dewi Griffiths (Kevin Evans) with times of 28.07.97 and 28.16.07 respectively.
In the shorter events, Chris O?Hare (Terrance Mahon) opened his season with a second place finish in 3.39.05, with Robbie Fitzgibbon (Jon Bigg) chasing him hard all the way in third, his time 3.40.42. Sarah McDonald (Bud Baldaro) was fifth in the women?s race in 4.12.05, whilst in the third section Katie Snowdon (Denmark) took victory in a new personal best of 4.12.21. British Athletics has announced the dates and locations for the 2016/17 Cross Challenge. The series incorporates five key fixtures across the autumn and winter season as thousands of athletes seek to become Britain?s best cross country athletes.
The Cross Challenge offers five high quality and competitive cross country opportunities for athletes which culminate with the series finale, being held in Loughborough for the first time in March 2017. In order to be eligible for prizes at the Final, athletes must have competed in two of the previous four cross challenge fixtures. There is no entry fee for those who qualify.
The Cross Challenge also gives up-and-coming athletes the opportunity to match themselves against established cross country stars with competitive fields catering for all age-groups; senior, under-20, under-17, under-15 and under-13.
The Cross Challenge events will be held at Milton Keynes, Liverpool, Antrim, Cardiff and Loughborough.
With cash prizes on offer, the British Athletics Cross Challenge guarantees fantastic racing opportunities.
British Athletics believes that the series is a fundamental pathway for endurance competitors and looks forward to once again working with the various organisers who deliver quality events each time.British Athletics' Club:Connect initiative has the objective of recognising and rewarding the significant contributions made by clubs in supporting athletes through all levels of their athletics journey. The initiative has gone from strength to strength since being launched in January 2014 and plans to continue growing! Clubs are the foundation of the athletics pyramid, British Athletics recognises this and will be using our global award winning major events to showcase clubs and age group athletes in different formats.
Launched in January 2014 to coincide with the indoor season, a number of local Scottish clubs took part in medley relays at the Glasgow International Match, infront of 5,000 spectators at the Emirates Arena. The campaign went from strength to strength throughout the rest of the 2014 season, as the first event Club:Connect champions were crowned.
Don't forget to visit the Club:Connect stand which features in our spectator village at each of our events!
Currently the Club:Connect competition is in two forms; elite athletes collecting points for their club throughout the British Championships competition with the chance of winning ?500 for their club, and the U13-U20 club relays where each team has the chance to win ?250 for their club.Club:Connect relays - 2017 season

British Athletics? Club:Connect campaign returns for the 2017 season, with events taking place both at the British Athletics Indoor Team Trials on 11-12 February 2017 and the British Athletics Outdoor Team Trials on 1-2 July 2017.
At the Team Trials in Sheffield and Birmingham, points will be on offer for the clubs of all athletes competing, with each athlete winning one point for their club and the top eight in each event winning an extra eight points for the winner down to one point for eighth place.
Winning clubs will be given grant for ?500. I'm terribly excited for the 2019 World Cup in Japan - and having seen Wednesday's draw, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales should all be confident of reaching at least the quarter-finals.
England have the ability and mindset to emerge from what is a tough pool, Scotland's match with Ireland could decide top spot in their group, while Wales will expect to go through - although Georgia will be determined to pull off an upset.
The level of competition in the sport is getting closer and closer across the world - we saw that improvement in the Six Nations this year.
However, the quality of the Rugby Championship is a bit lower at the moment - New Zealand excepted - because South Africa are struggling and Australia have their problems.
So with the northern hemisphere sides being much closer to the southern hemisphere teams now, Japan 2019 could be when a team from the north regains the World Cup.
England face tough draw, Ireland and Scotland in same pool
'There will be a lot of buzz in Japan'
'Jones' England have a different mindset' Pool C
England
France
Argentina
Americas 1
Oceania 2
It's old fashioned to call it a "Pool of Death", so let's just call it what it is - it's a group that nobody would want.
I can imagine all the coaches, even New Zealand's Steve Hansen, thinking, "I don't want that hard a group," but England head coach Eddie Jones, France's Guy Noves and their Argentina counterpart Daniel Hourcade have got it.
Argentina can be unpredictable - they will be strong but I'm not sure about their age profile. In years gone by it has tended to be quite high and they haven't got a lot of resources or strength in depth.
Understrength England face Argentina in two Tests in June but Jones' tourists are massive underdogs and I don't expect them to win as they will have 15 players away with the British and Irish Lions. With 15 of your best players out you should not be able to go to Argentina and beat a full-strength Pumas.
France have improved but they are typically not great away from home. However, they are traditionally good in World Cup tournaments so it's a tough one for England.
But Jones' team has got a different mindset to Stuart Lancaster's side, which went out in the pool stages in 2015. The current team have won a Grand Slam and a Six Nations Championship and many of them have won three consecutive Tests against Australia away from home. They have an identity as winners.
He says they have to be ready to beat anyone but you would prefer a comfortable route to the quarter-final. You want a good sweat and some competition but don't want to be beaten.
If I was playing I would have liked an easy group before what is going to be a hard quarter-final, whoever you play. Every side in the top eight can beat one another on the day.
'Scotland will believe they can beat Ireland' Pool A
Ireland
Scotland
Japan
Europe 1
Play-off winner (Europe 2 v Oceania 3)
Ireland and Scotland know each other so well. Scotland beat Ireland at Murrayfield in the Six Nations this year by scoring three tries so they will have no problem believing they can win that game.
But both sides will know they can get through to the quarter-finals, while Scotland saw off Japan when they played in 2015.
Japan could be a bit better at home than they were under Eddie Jones in England, when they stunned South Africa in the group stages. But we don't know much about their new boss Jamie Joseph and we know that Jones is a special coach.
Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt is a master tactician but we don't know much about incoming Scotland head coach Gregor Townsend at international level.
Townsend will want to build on the side that won three home games in the Six Nations but improve on those poor away performances.
He'll have 20 games or so, including two more Six Nations tournaments, before the World Cup to get those poor performances out of the window and build a team strong enough to get through.
'Parallels between Wales and Australia'Pool D
Australia
Wales
Georgia
Oceania 1
Americas 2
Georgia are a tough emerging side who have been banging on the door of the Six Nations for a while, wanting to be recognised.
They have an opportunity in the next two seasons to boost their team and build themselves so they can prove a point against Wales.
Wales should have been in their prime in 2015 but they were injury ravaged and conceded a soft try to lose the quarter-final to South Africa.
In 2011 they were a young squad that got to the semi-finals. In 2019 a lot of those key players will all be over 30 years old - not past their sell-by date, but the squad needs some new players coming through.
There are still some question marks over whether Warren Gatland wants to continue with Wales after the Lions tour, but he has a great record as a coach and if he's still there, his and the players' experience will see them through the group.
Australia were in a similar position to Wales in 2011 and 2015. Rugby union is facing difficult times in Australia so it will be interesting to see how they do in 2019.
They are always good in World Cups, whether they are coming in with poor or good form, but we'll see if they can still be successful with all the challenges they face domestically.
'All Blacks will ease through with South Africa in huge decline' Pool B
New Zealand
South Africa
Italy
Africa 1
Repechage winner
Holders New Zealand have got a nice work-out leading into a quarter-final.
Two-time champions South Africa are nowhere near the force they once were - they are in huge decline. There are over 350 South African players playing outside their country and I don't see them challenging unless a quick storm of talent starts appearing in the next two years.
Although Italy beat South Africa in November they won't spring a surprise in the World Cup - they were appalling in the Six Nations.
Head coach Conor O'Shea has the opportunity to improve but I'm not sure they have enough time. A lot of players learn by rote so that things eventually become automatic - that's difficult to do in a short space of time unless you have the natural talent.
But Sergio Parisse has been Italy's best player for over a decade now and they need someone new of his calibre to come through. South Africa's Akani Simbine continued his impressive start to 2017 by beating Justin Gatlin and Andre de Grasse in the 100m at the Doha Diamond League.
The 23-year-old clocked his sixth sub-10 second time of the season as he came home in 9.99, ahead of Asafa Powell.
Gatlin was fourth in 10.14, behind Femi Ogunode (10.13) and ahead of De Grasse, who was fifth in 10.21.
Jamaica's Olympic champion Elaine Thompson beat the Netherlands' Dafne Schippers in the 200m.
The pair were separated by only a tenth of a second in last year's Olympic final, and Thompson triumphed in Doha by 0.26 seconds in a time of 22.19.
Britain's Robbie Grabarz, who took silver in the European Indoors in March, claimed second place in the high jump, clearing 2.31m in his first outdoor event of the season.
Watch highlights of the Doha Diamond League on BBC One on Saturday at 13:45 BST (not in Northern Ireland). Olympic champion Caster Semenya claimed a commanding victory in the 800m, coming home in a world-leading time of one minute 56.61 seconds.
Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba, who won silver behind the South African in Rio, was the only other woman to better that time in the whole of 2016.
Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba - who broke a 22-year-old 1500m world record in 2015 and won silver over the distance in Rio - was fifth in her first 800m outing.
Rohler joins javelin greats Olympic champion Thomas Rohler threw 93.90m to win the javelin competition by more than four metres.
The German's throw moves him to second in the all-time list, with only Czech great Jan Zelezny having thrown further.
British round-up
Desiree Henry was well short of the 22.69 she clocked earlier this year in California as the 21-year-old finished seventh in the 200m.
Holly Bradshaw, who missed the indoor season with injury, finished fourth in the pole vault with a best of 4.55m.
Cindy Ofili finished down in seventh as American world record-holder Kendra Harrison won the 100m hurdles in 12.59, while Andrew Butchart came eighth in the 3,000m and Chris Baker finished seventh in the high jump.
Plans to rewrite world records set before 2005 are "disrespectful, an injustice and a slap in the face", says former long jumper Mike Powell, who stands to lose his own world record.
The proposals by European Athletics are part of attempts to make a clean break with the sport's doping scandals.
If the move is approved, world records would only be recognised if they can stand up to strict new criteria.
But Powell, 53, told BBC World Service he would legally challenge any ruling.
"I've already contacted my attorney," said the American, whose mark of 8.95 metres set in August 1991 has never been bettered.
"There are some records out there that are kind of questionable, I can see that, but mine is the real deal. It's a story of human heart and guts, one of the greatest moments in the sport's history.
How will world records be recognised?
Which star names would lose out?
GB athletes are "collateral damage"
"They would be destroying so many things with this decision, without thinking about it. It's wrong. Regardless of what happens, I am going to fight."
Lord Coe, president of athletics' governing body the IAAF, called for a "global debate" around the issue.
He told BBC London: "These proposals will come back to the council and I look forward to maybe counter proposals and maybe changes, maybe thoughts around it.
"We have to start somewhere. This is a debate the athletes have prompted the administrators to have for far too long." European Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in January.
Its ruling council has ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants world governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to back them when its council meets in August.
Taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan told BBC Sport on Tuesday the plans were about "restoring credibility".
"Obviously this has to stand up to a court of law," he added.
"This is about the sport regaining control of its rules and records. Because in the past there have been threats of legal action when this has been mooted."
Asked whether more legal challenges were expected, he said: "No, we've just changed the rules of the sport. These are sports rules. It would be like somebody challenging the referee in a football game."
IAAF President Lord Coe has called for a "global debate" around the issue, telling BBC London: "It's important that we have these discussions.
"These proposals will come back to the council and I look forward to maybe counter proposals and maybe changes, maybe thoughts around it.
"We have to start somewhere. This is a debate the athletes have prompted the administrators to have for far too long."
Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, has called the proposals "cowardly".
However, fellow British runner Darren Campbell says the move would be "for the greater good".
Powell set the long jump world record at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, beating Bob Beamon's mark of 8.90m, which had led the field for 23 years.
Twenty-six years on, only the discus throw (1986), the hammer throw (1986) and shot put (1990) world records have stood for longer in men's outdoor athletics. Championship tip
The biggest thing I?ve learned is keep your composure under pressure and stay focused on yourself and not on what other athletes are doing. Focus on yourself and don?t be distracted by what goes on around you.
One technique I use during a major championship is to listen to Christian music. I find the music motivating. It helps lift my spirits, but also keeps me calm. This ensures that when it is time to compete, I am ready.
Coaching tip
I don?t think I have one piece of advice, but I remember my high school coach, Mr. Smith, once saying that I was ?a fighter? and that I am very competitive no matter what. I?ve always remembered what he told me. He believed in me and I think it is true.
Technical tip
This is only something I?ve recently learned from my current coach, Reynaldo Walcott: the importance of speed as a 400m runner.
I am quite unusual for a 400m runner in that I?m not really a fan of running the 100m or 200m. Yet he breaks down the sprinting technique and the importance behind it and I take it more seriously. I now understand the importance of speed work.
Tip for surviving the athletics circuit
I never liked travelling from meet to meet ? I always feel so tired competing. But if I could pass on any advice, it would be to learn to control your sleep when it is time to sleep.
To help overcome the jet-lag, if I hop on a flight in the morning and it is evening in the place where I am flying to, I try to sleep on the plane. It doesn?t work out all the time, but it helps.
I also try to hydrate as much as I can. I now feel less tired and it is reflected in my improved performances. My parents always told me I always knew what I wanted. So, if I say, I am going over the bridge, I go over the bridge. If I make a decision in life, I tend to stick my that decision.
Cooking tip
I?m not a fancy cook, so I would say try and cook something that is easy to prepare. I don?t like bread, so one thing I love to cook is Macaroni cheese and boiled egg!
Fashion tip
I love heels. I don?t really have a rule for wearing them as I don?t get the opportunity too often. I might wear heels two or three times a month on a Sunday when I go to church. I think heels give you a lift and make you look elegant.
Vacation tip
When picking somewhere to go, follow your passion. I like going to amusement parks and even though the rides look scary, I will try them all. I also love nature and would one day love to go on a safari ? even though deep in my heart I might be scared of the animals!
Social media tip
I have Twitter and Instagram, but I don?t post too often. For social media you have to be careful what you post. As role models we need to be careful what we post. You are not posting pictures to yourself. You are posting them to the world!
Driving tip
I learned to drive in high school, but I don?t drive a lot right now. I learned how to drive a manual but whenever I drive an automatic vehicle I sometimes make the mistake of using both feet! I guess my tip would be make sure you drive an automatic with just one foot.
Dating tip
Keep it in the dating zone and don?t rush things because that is when it can get messed up. Full-time professional runner, part-time cancer fighter.
Or is it full-time cancer fighter and part-time professional runner?
The truth is these days, I?m not really sure.
I have spent the past six and half years mostly focused on the running, fortunately, and not so much on the cancer. But things have changed for me since last August.
I don?t know how many of you were following along since this little event known as the Olympics was going on, but after failing to make US Olympic Team for Rio, I spent the rest of my summer dealing with a cancer recurrence ? and plotting a way back into competitive mid-distance running.
In 2016, the rare cancer [adenoid cystic carcinoma, ACC] I was diagnosed with in my salivary gland in 2009 had returned, this time in my liver. My husband Justin, an internal medicine resident physician, gave me a hug on a Sunday morning in early August and noticed that something felt weird about my abdomen. I agreed. I had felt some tingling and fullness in that area over the last month or so, but nothing painful or too out of the ordinary. Long story short, a trip to the ER later that same day showed what we had both feared: there was a large tumour in my liver.
The next few days and weeks were filled with oncology appointments, a biopsy confirming the lesion was metastatic ACC, and a plan for surgery. I felt extremely lucky that the tumour was in my liver as I learned what an amazing and resilient organ it is. My surgical oncologist explained that after I underwent a right hepatectomy; the left half of my liver would grow into the space previously occupied by the right and essentially function as a normal liver after about two weeks. They expected to remove all the tumour during surgery and I prayed that would be the case.
I woke up disoriented from the anesthesia on the afternoon of August 26th to the good news that even though he had a tougher time than expected removing the tumour in one piece, my surgeon felt confident that they got it all out. What a huge relief! I left the hospital six days later on September 1st with a gnarly 13-inch incision in its early phase of healing, feeling pretty rough but overall pleased with my recovery. I had lost about ten pounds and walked hunched over a bit from the forward lean I used to protect the initial pain of stretching the scar, but I was doing well. Well enough to attend my brother?s wedding that weekend and shimmy around awkwardly on the dance floor.
Going for long walks and riding my bike alongside Justin on his runs were my exercise of choice for the first few weeks after surgery. I enjoyed the perfect fall weather in Minneapolis and even though I was a little sad I wasn?t able to run in it, I was just happy to be alive and presumably cancer-free.
"I had to walk home from more than a couple of runs."
Fast forward to November and I was getting antsy about training for the upcoming track season. The abdominal muscles that were sliced through in August were still healing but getting closer to feeling normal. Some manual therapy and exercises had helped expedite the process, but I knew my body would heal in its own time ? whether that took a few months or over a year remained to be seen. Since the surgery, I had tried to start up running a handful of times up to about four miles at a time before having to stop due to incision-related pain.
Whenever I felt something sharp, I immediately stopped. I had to walk home from more than a couple of runs and did my best to listen to my body when something didn?t feel right. Right around Thanksgiving I completed my first (really slow) five-mile run and that turned out to the build-up that stuck. I did an eight-mile long run in December and the rest is history! Not really, but that?s when I felt about 85 per cent like myself again, and I knew that I?d be able to get back to doing what I love ? racing ? at some point in 2017. That point has turned out to be this Friday, May 5th at the Payton Jordan Invitational where I will run the 1500 meters. With the support of Brooks, my coach, Dennis Barker, my amazing husband and my family and friends, I have returned to fitness and I am nervous/excited to find out what I am capable of on the track.
I had dreams of an epic comeback this season ? my goal was to be both fitter than ever and cancer-free ? but I didn?t get the fairytale ending I was hoping for, at least not yet. I found out in March in my first post-op scan that I still have cancer in my liver. We?re not sure if it is all new cancer or if some was left behind from the surgery. It doesn?t really matter. There are small tumours, too many for a surgery. I need treatment.
"When I?m in the middle of a workout I?m not thinking about surviving cancer, I?m just trying to survive the workout."
Since finding out about the new cancer, I have used running as therapy, much like I did through my three previous cancer experiences. The simple act of running is always a welcome diversion from the overwhelming uncertainty of my future. And you can?t really cry while you run, which is great! When I?m in the middle of a workout I?m not thinking about surviving cancer, I?m just trying to survive the workout.
I still dream about running fast this year and beyond, but the truth is I don?t really know what?s going to happen or how much elite running is realistically in front of me. All I can do right now is approach each day like I approach each rep of a workout: one at a time, doing my best to hang on until the next one.
Next week I will travel to New York City to meet with a head & neck oncology specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. There I will hopefully l figure out when I will start treatment and what I will start with first: chemotherapy, a clinical trial [immunotherapy], or some radiation technique. I am planning to race through the month of May regardless of whether or not I?ve started treatment, with the goal of running the qualifying standard for USA Championships in the 1500m.
So this is the scary part: I have a rare cancer for which there is no cure and limited effective treatment options available. But this is the hopeful part: cancer medicine is advancing every day and there are a couple of clinical trials for ACC starting soon. And the best part: I am alive, I am loved, and I still feel good enough to run.
Cancer can stop you from doing a lot of things, I?m well aware of that. But I?m more interested in what cancer can?t stop me from doing. Here?s to finding out.
Photography by Ben Blair Replace ?love? with ?pole vault? and the poem turns into Murto?s answer to what she likes about her event: ?If you try to make sense of it, it doesn?t make any sense. It?s riskier, it?s so much more risky than any other event in track and field.
?I think it?s more fun because it?s a little riskier. It takes a person who likes the risk and likes that dangerous element.
?If you?re afraid, it makes your jump a lot harder. If you?re even a little insecure, it?s not going to be as good. You have to have trust in yourself. It?s more dangerous if you?re afraid.?
She is right. Broken poles and fractured bones are a regular occurrence on the international pole vault circuit. Luckily, the 18-year-old has never snapped a pole in her life. In fact, it was injury troubles in other events that saw her end up with the pole vault in the first place.
Murto started athletics at the age of four. Aged nine her mother encouraged her to have a shot at the pole vault after she?d been on a coaching course with Murto?s current trainer Jarno Koivunen.
?I did some sprints, some high jump, but I think I?m a little prone to accidents, so high jump isn?t the best for my feet,? explains Murto. Little by little she dropped the other events.
Mother Murto?s hunch of her daughter?s potential in the pole vault proved right. In 2014, aged just 16, she competed at the World U20 Championships in Eugene, Oregon. Last year she cleared an outright world U20 best of 4.71m in Zweibrucken, Germany in January. Her outdoor PB followed in Turku, Finland with 4.52m in June.
In July, despite being one of the youngest in the field, she entered the World U20 Championships in Bydgoszcz as one of the favourites. She finished third with 4.40m, Switzerland?s Angelica Moser took gold in 4.55m. Murto went on to compete at the Olympics in August and finished 24th in qualifying. At the time, she was disappointed, but since has found a different outlook on her 2016 season. ?If I think back now, it was very good,? she reflects.
?It wasn?t perfect, but nothing is perfect. I didn?t wish for bronze in Poland, but all together I think it was good the way it was ? I learnt more. It was much more experience for the future that way.?
And experience ? especially outdoors ? is one of the key ingredients the 18-year-old is still lacking. Because she is still in high school in Turku, Murto spends all of her winter in Finland training indoors, while most of her international competition heads off to warmer climates.
Rather than making excuses, however, she focuses on improving ?everything? about her vaulting. Technically ?pretty strong? for her age, she has ?a lot to catch up with? physically in order to reach consistent heights.
?I think because I?m tall, everything takes more time ? to build strength in the body,? she explains. This past indoor season she vaulted an U20 WL 4.66m in Tignes, France. Now she is determined to carry those heights outdoors. Consistency is the objective for now, then the medals will follow.
?I haven?t really thought about the world championships, because for now I don?t think to get all the medals is the main thing to focus on. I have years to do that.
?Of course, if everything goes well and training goes well in the spring, why not go as high as I can in London? Also, I have the European Junior Championships, so that might be the main goal. I guess I could say I want the gold medal there, so that?s the one I can say for sure.?
The other thing Murto is sure about is her future in the sport. She still has another year left in high school and while she doesn?t ?have any plans academic-wise? yet, her future on the track is safe.
?I know I want to do athletics and pole vault. Pole vaulters are a very close community and I think that?s one of the greatest things about the event.? Reigning Olympic javelin champion Thomas Rohler joined the illustrious 90-metre-club last summer. The German shares some of his best pieces of training, competition and lifestyle advice.
Championship tip
?Just do it, because you have done it before? ?? by this I mean try not to be fazed by the competition and just perform as you have done in the past. This is a skill I needed to learn over time. I was not really a championship athlete from the beginning.
When you compete at a worlds or a Europeans the name is special, but you have to remember that the competition is the same. It is important to block out the size of the competition and treat it like any other.
Tactical tip
The competition is never over until the sixth attempt. To believe in this sometimes helps me reach peak performance like in Ostrava last year when I went from third to first with my final throw.
Coaching tip
The philosophy of the training group is to ?steal with our eyes from everyone and everywhere?. By this I mean we can learn from everyone and every sport and apply it to our own sport.
At the moment, I?m looking to the sport of gymnastics to aid my training, although which sport and which techniques I look at changes all the time depending on the training period.
Technical tip
It came from Andreas Thorkildsen?s coach during a training camp in Norway when he said they worked a lot on targeting. He meant targeting something on the horizon, like a tree, to enable the thrower to release at the right angle. It is something we have applied to our training.
Cooking tip
I learned from my girlfriend ? thanks to her Italian roots ? how to make homemade pasta. It is always nice to eat something handmade!
Fashion tip
I think it is what every grandparent says, ?make sure you dress warm enough in winter?.
 Best tip for surviving the athletics circuit
The Kenyan, 32, clocked 2:00.25 but because in-out pacemakers were used, the time will not be recognised as a world record, meaning Dennis Kimetto's mark of 2:02.57 is still the quickest.
But Kipchoge said: "This is history."
Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia also raced in the behind-closed-doors Nike event in Italy but faded earlier in the attempt.
The three athletes chased the landmark time running 2.4km laps on the Monza Grand Prix circuit, 63 years to the day since Britain's Roger Bannister ran the first ever sub four-minute mile.
Monza was chosen by the sportswear company for its gentle corners and favourable climatic conditions. Small groups of pacemakers ran pre-defined segments of the circuit before handing over to another group, and the trio did not have to slow down for feed stations as drinks were delivered by scooter.
Kipchoge ran each mile at an average pace of around four minutes and 36 seconds. To achieve a sub-two clocking, the Olympic champion would have effectively had to run 17 seconds for 100 metres 422 times in a row.
He lapped 27-year-old Desisa, who finished in 2:14.10, while Tadese, 35, came home in 2:06.51. Kipchoge always looked the stronger and was on target pace with around seven miles to go but he began grimacing in the closing stages and though he tried to sprint up the home straight, his fatigue was obvious.
Pacemakers applauded and encouraged him as he approached the line and the clocking comfortably outstrips his recognised personal best of 2:03.05, set at the London Marathon in 2016.
"I'm happy to have run two hours for the marathon," added Kipchoge. "My mind was fully on the two hours but the last kilometre was behind the schedule. This journey has been good - it has been seven months of dedication."
Women's world-record holder Paula Radcliffe called Kipchoge's run "truly inspiring".
Only a select few media were allowed in to witness the attempt at the race circuit near Milan and Kipchoge's time was initially reported to be a second quicker until Nike confirmed the 2:00.25 clocking.
The brand paid the three runners to forgo the London and Berlin Marathons this year prompting some criticism of the event given the resources invested and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record.
Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting.
Eliud Kipchoge is, I believe, the greatest physical specimen ever to line up on a marathon start line. If he can't run sub-two, then I don't see another athlete that will do it any time soon.
Kipchoge ran close to the legitimate world record in London in 2016, and perhaps would have broken it in Berlin the year before if his shoes that day hadn't lost their insoles.
He's made history of sorts in Monza, and he's right to be proud of pushing the boundaries. What he needs to do now is break the world record on an IAAF-recognised course.
He has the talent to do that and the world record is all that's missing from a phenomenal career.
The 23-year-old clocked his sixth sub-10 second time of the season as he came home in 9.99, ahead of Asafa Powell.
Gatlin was fourth in 10.14, behind Femi Ogunode (10.13) and ahead of De Grasse, who was fifth in 10.21.
Jamaica's Olympic champion Elaine Thompson beat the Netherlands' Dafne Schippers in the 200m.
The pair were separated by only a tenth of a second in last year's Olympic final, and Thompson triumphed in Doha by 0.26 seconds in a time of 22.19.
Britain's Robbie Grabarz, who took silver in the European Indoors in March, claimed second place in the high jump, clearing 2.31m in his first outdoor event of the season.
Olympic champion Caster Semenya claimed a commanding victory in the 800m, coming home in a world-leading time of one minute 56.61 seconds.
Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba, who won silver behind the South African in Rio, was the only other woman to better that time in the whole of 2016.
Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba - who broke a 22-year-old 1500m world record in 2015 and won silver over the distance in Rio - was fifth in her first 800m outing.
The governing body only wants records to be recognised if they can stand up to strict new criteria, part of attempts to make a clean break with the sport's doping scandals.
As a result, any records set before 2005 are now at risk - almost half of the 146 men's and women's indoor and outdoor records. These include marks that have never been subject to suspicion, prompting an outcry from many of the existing record holders.
Seven of the eight men's field events world records and the women's 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m marks could go.
Olympic champions including Florence Griffith-Joyner, Michael Johnson, Hicham El Guerrouj and Jonathan Edwards will fall off the world record list on to an 'all-time list' if the proposals are ratified by the the sport's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), in August.
Meanwhile, athletes who have competed after 2005 may soon find themselves with a 'WR' next to their name if the sport's record achievements are - in the words of IAAF chief Lord Coe - "recalibrated".
Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m, set in 1995, is among the long-standing records under threat.
The Olympic, world and European champion jumped into the history books at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg as he became the first man to pass the 18-metre mark. American Christian Taylor, who jumped 18.21m in August 2015, would in all likelihood be promoted to world record holder.
Long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe set a world record of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds in the 2003 London Marathon using two male pacemakers. Her record would be taken by this year's London winner Mary Keitany, who finished in 2:17:01.
Welsh hurdler Colin Jackson set the indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs in 1994, and Britain can still lay claim - for now - to the 4x200m indoor relay record of 1:21.11, set in Glasgow in 1991 by a team that included Linford Christie, who won Olympic 100m gold the following year.
American sprinter Griffith-Joyner, also known as Flo Jo, won three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
The former world champion, who died aged 38 in 1998, still holds the 100m and 200m world records. She ran 10.49secs at the US Olympic trials at the University at Indianapolis in July 1988 and then two months later set the 200m world record of 21.34secs at the Games in South Korea.
Fellow American Carmelita Jeter would potentially move up from second on the all-time 100m list with her 2009 time of 10.64secs.
The European Athletics proposals include scrapping the records of anyone caught doping, even if the record was set outside the time period in which they were proven to be cheating. That could mean Dutch sprinter Dafne Schippers taking the new 200m record with her time of 21.63secs set in 2015. She is currently third on the list but drug cheat Marion Jones' legal time of 21.62secs from 1998 would also be removed from the books.
One of the biggest casualties from the rule change could be Moroccan middle-distance runner El Guerrouj, who stands to lose five world records.
The 42-year-old, who is a double Olympic champion and four-time world champion, is the current 1500m, one mile and 2,000m record holder.
In 1998, in Rome, El Guerrouj broke the 1500m record with a run of three minutes 26 seconds. In 1999, also in Rome, he set a new mark for the mile with a time of 3:43.13 and then later that season he set a new 2,000m record of 4:44.79 minutes in Berlin.
El Guerrouj also holds the indoor 1500m and mile world records, which he set in 1997.
His 1500m mark would go to Kenya's Olympic champion Asbel Kiprop, who would move up from third on the list with a 2015 time that was only 0.69 seconds behind El Guerrouj's record.
More dramatically, American Alan Webb could jump from eighth on the all-time list for the mile to take the record with a time from 2007 that is more than three seconds slower than El Guerrouj's mark.
Australian Craig Mottram would take the 2,000m world record with his time from 2006 of 4:50.76, despite being 10th on the all-time list.
American long jumper Mike Powell, a two-time world champion, set his record of 8.95m 26 years ago at the 1991 Tokyo World Championships, breaking the existing record by five centimetres - Bob Beamon's legendary leap from the Mexico City Olympics that had itself stood for 23 years.
With Powell and Beamon's jumps chalked off and nine-time gold medallist Carl Lewis' jump of 8.87m from 1991 also not eligible, the record would most likely go to another American, Dwight Phillips, who would move up from fifth with his 2009 leap of 8.74m.
Three-time Olympic javelin champion Jan Zelezny, a rival of Britain's Steve Backley, threw 98.48m in Germany in 1996. His world record is still more than five metres further than the second best throw of all time. Kenya's Julius Yego currently has the third best of all time but his 92.72m throw in 2015 would be in line to take top spot under the new criteria.
Four-time Olympic gold medallist Johnson has already lost his 200m world record to Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt and his 400m mark to South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk and could be about to lose a third.
Johnson was part of the US team that ran a time of 2:54.39 in the 4x400m relay at the 1993 World Championships. Harry Reynolds, Andrew Valmon and Quincy Watts made up the quartet.
Ethiopian long-distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is a three-time Olympic and five-time world champion and also the 5,000m and 10,000m record holder. It's the former record that he might soon lose as his time of 12:37.55 was set in May 2004. It would go to countryman Dejen Gebremeskel who is fifth on the existing list with 12:46.81, nine seconds off Bekele's record.
American Sanya Richards-Ross would take one of the most controversial records, the women's 400m. That was set in 1985 at 47.60 seconds by Marita Koch, who competed for the former East Germany.
The next four athletes on the current list, including Sydney Olympic champion Cathy Freeman, who ran her best time at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, would also be erased from the record books, leaving Richards' 48.70 as the best time. Only three other runners in the top 20 set their time after 2005 - Allyson Felix in Beijing in 2015 (49.26), Russia's Yuliya Gushchina (49.28) in 2012 and her compatriot Antonina Krivoshapka (49.16) in 2012 - and Krivoshapka was this year revealed to have tested positive for steroid turinabol during the re-examination of samples from London 2012.
Kevin Young is the only man to have run the 400m hurdles in under 47 seconds. His winning time of 46.78secs at the 1992 Olympics could be replaced by fellow American Kerron Clement's 47.24 set in June 2005.
Only two women have broken into the top 20 times in the women's 800m since 2005, and if Jarmila Kratochv?lova of the former Czechoslovakia loses her 1983 record of 1:53.28, Kenya's Pamela Jelimo, third on the list, would be promoted with her 2008 time of 1:54.01.
American Jackie Joyner-Kersee's heptathlon points record of 7,291 from her Olympic gold-medal performance in Seoul in 1988 would be replaced by Carolina Kluft's 7,032 points from 2007. Britain's Jessica Ennis-Hill is currently third on the list.
Paula Radcliffe, Jonathan Edwards and Colin Jackson are among "collateral damage" says European Athletics taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.
But he told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is a bigger picture out there."
All pre-2005 records could be rewritten under the new rules, which need to be ratified by governing body, the IAAF.
O'Callaghan said: "Apologies to the athletes, we never intended to damage their reputation and legacy. It is intended to give the public belief and credibility in what they are watching in the sport."
But BBC athletics commentator and former world 1500m champion Steve Cram called the proposals an "easy route out" and "a PR exercise".
Cram set world records for the 1500m, mile and 2,000m in the space of 19 days in 1985, and still holds the European records for the latter two distances - although under the proposals those pre-2005 European records would join world records in being reset.
He added that the measures are "not going to stop people cheating".
The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) has only stored blood and urine samples since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an "all-time list", but not be officially recognised as records if the IAAF accepts the proposal.
European Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting, while IAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were "a step in the right direction".
The world records to fall would include Edwards' triple jump mark of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world best of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon time of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.
O'Callaghan compared the changes to English football introducing the Premier League above the First Division in 1992 and rugby union's Five Nations becoming the Six Nations in 2000, and said the records will be "recalibrated".
"We hope people look at it in that vein, rather than stripping great athletes like Paula of their records," added O'Callaghan, who said he had spoken to Radcliffe and Edwards.
"Unfortunately Paula ran her records in a golden period that happens to be two years before the technology moved on.
"People should not look at Paula's records and throw them in with doping records - she achieved her performance, as did Jonathan, with 100% integrity.
"This is about the bigger picture of reform in athletics and ensuring the public in events like the London World Championships [in August 2017], that they can believe what they are watching."
If the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world or European record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:
It was achieved at a competition on a list of approved international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment can be guaranteed;
The athlete had been subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to it;
The doping control sample taken after the record was stored and available for re-testing for 10 years.
More than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.
Jackson added: "They are making excuses on why they are doing it. I think it is a wrong reason why they are doing it. We all understand the situation with doping but it is not the fault of the clean athletes."
We are all trying to make sure we look at ways we can improve the integrity of our sport but this smacks to me as an easy route out. There are massive issues for the sport to contend with and this, for me, is almost a PR exercise.
I can't believe that if the public don't have credibility now that they are going to have it going forward. I don't think it changes much. It's very confusing for people, and it's going to affect everybody all the way down.
It lumps us all in with those cheats. It's not our fault that over the years the sport did not police itself properly. It's not our fault they didn't do their job. I don't think it's going to change anything. It's not going to stop people cheating.
I was chatting with the president of European Athletics and asked "have you thought this through?". I am not convinced they have. All the member federations of European Athletics will have to scrap their national records because you can't have a national record quicker than the European record, and so on.
Part of the worst aspect of it is that in the document that they are putting forward, they are talking about preserving the dignity of the athletes as well. It's about preserving their own dignity.
It's an easy cop out. They haven't been able to make the tough decisions. If there are records that they believe that shouldn't be on the books then they should go after those with whatever scrutiny they have can. If they can't do that, then this is their problem to deal with.
We all lose our records eventually. It's fine somebody comes along and breaks it but what is not fair is that the federation decides that is not the record any more. As a broadcaster, what do I say to the public?
In the early days, there was no drug testing, did we scrap all of those records? No. Then, drug testing was introduced and now we have tougher drug testing. That's fine, we all accept that. Maybe some things slipped through the net in the past but you can't keep drawing a line every five years.
The farcical thing they are going to end up with, is that there will still be people holding records who have had a ban - but the records they set were before the ban and those will still stand. Somebody fails a test in 2015 and then all of their performances for that period are scrapped. But if they set a record in 2012, that stays. That's silly.
His time of three minutes 59.4 seconds broke both psychological and physiological barriers.
Now, 63 years later, an attempt will be made to shatter another of sport's landmark times - a sub two-hour marathon.
Bannister's mile was a triumph of Corinthian values and spirit.
However, this marathon - to be run in under 120 minutes - is organised by sportswear giant Nike and the event, taking place in northern Italy on Saturday morning, has a distinctly corporate feel about it.
It is the ultimate endurance test, but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see.
So is it an expensive PR and marketing exercise?
Or, given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26.2 miles, should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights?
The world record for the marathon was set by Kenya's Dennis Kimetto in Berlin in 2014. His time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours.
However, it will be not be Kimetto stepping up to this challenge. The job lies instead with his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia.
Kipchoge, as the reigning Olympic marathon champion, perhaps has the greatest chance. His personal best of 2:03.05, set in London in 2016, is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record.
To break the two-hour marathon barrier, a runner would need to beat the fastest-ever marathon by about 3%. That means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the race's 26.2 miles.
Therefore, to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement - something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible.
Nike don't really do perceived wisdom though.
They have signed up the three elite performers, paying them to forego the London and Berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded "Breaking2".
Historical weather patterns have been studied and a three-day window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions.
It has since been narrowed further and so, at 05:45 local time on Saturday morning, the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history, but not the record books.
This is because of the use of in-out pacemakers, 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level. Their use is against athletics regulations, so no matter what time is set on Saturday morning, it won't be considered a valid world record.
The pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds.
Nike's legion of scientists, performance coaches, nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance. Mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners' legs, core temperature pills (an ingestible thermometer that transmits data) are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success.
Staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they don't waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables.
Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting; perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity.
But Nike's vice president of special projects, Sandy Bodecker, is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have, even if it is under such controlled conditions.
The attempt is also notable in that the world's media are being blocked from witnessing it. This is very much a behind-closed-doors event, which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by.
There will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of Formula 1 tifosi on race days.
It suggests that, with everything else under tight control, spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand. The very early start time, no doubt, presents logistical issues too.
Instead, Nike have allowed a few hand-picked journalists to attend who have also covered the build-up to the big day. A web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track.
Some supporters of the project have called it a "moonshot", given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point.
So, just like Neil Armstrong's famous first step on the lunar surface in 1969, the world will be required to watch and wonder.
Saturday 6 May is the preferred date, which is also the 63rd anniversary of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute barrier for the mile.
There are definite parallels. There was plenty of controversy about Bannister's attempt, just as there is about what's happening in Monza.
But an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been. If anyone can do this, it's Eliud Kipchoge.
But that still means him running more than three minutes faster than his current best. The man, not the shoes nor the science, will have to find most of that.
However Jamaica-based duo Zharnel Hughes and Miguel Francis are among fierce competition for the two spots on offer at July's British team trials.
"Making that team - you'll know you are among the world's best," said Gemili.
"It is going to be really difficult. The depth is great and everyone is going to have to be in good shape for the trials because nothing is given."
Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records.
She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m?
"We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated.
"Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?"
Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986.
Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased.
"I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.
The credibility of records was examined following the sport's doping scandal.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals "cowardly".
"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity," she said, adding that the governing bodies had "again failed clean athletes".
Svein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records "are meaningless if people don't really believe them".
However, Radcliffe said the changes were "heavy handed" and "confusing to the public".
Swann, who took 104 wickets in 79 one-day internationals, was referring to the 2015 World Cup when Eoin Morgan's team were humbled by a group-stage exit, in which they only won games against minnows Scotland and Afghanistan.
Since then, England have won series against World Cup runners-up New Zealand, Pakistan (twice), Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indies and now Ireland. They only lost to Australia and South Africa by the odd game in five.
They hammered Ireland despite the absence of key men Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, who are playing in the Indian Premier League.
Swann added: "They have such a strong middle order. Especially when you consider they can bring in Jos Buttler - one of the best in the world - and add him to that middle order and then Ben Stokes, who is arguably the best player in the world in all formats.
"Eoin Morgan and (head coach) Trevor Bayliss ripped up that piece of paper from 2015 and said 'that's nonsense', we'll get the right personnel in, fill them with confidence, back them to the hilt and ask them to try and post 400 when they bat.
"They scored 328 against Ireland and the captain said he felt they were 40 runs short. That's amazing to hear. Not too long ago, England captains and teams of old would have been cock-a-hoop with a score of 328."
His side can move seven points clear with three games left if they beat Middlesbrough on Monday (20:00 BST).
"I think Tottenham have an advantage, if you compare Tottenham to Chelsea," said the Italian.
"This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Mauricio Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players and is working very well.
"For me, Tottenham are a really strong team and it's normal to see them fighting for the title."
Conte believes Spurs, who were Leicester City's main challengers in 2015-16 before fading to finish third, would have easily won the Premier League this season if it were not for his side's impressive season.
"In this season, if Chelsea had not performed in this way, Tottenham would win the title without difficulty," he said.
"Only this great season from us is pushing them to fight and, maybe, to win or not to win the title."
The former Juventus and Italy boss could lead his side to a league and FA Cup double, 10 months after Chelsea finished 10th, with an FA Cup final against Arsenal on 27 May.
Unlike some of their rivals, Chelsea have not been involved in Europe and Conte thinks it is difficult for English clubs to succeed in the Champions League because of the strength of the Premier League.
In the past six years, five English clubs have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, compared to 17 from Spain and 10 in Germany.
Conte said: "This league is very difficult. Every single game you must fight a lot and, I think, also for this reason it's not easy to arrive at the end of a European competition.
"It is so clear here, every season will be tougher and tougher to qualify for the Champions League."
Enjoy it and have fun. Also, learn to enjoy travelling. Some athletes don?t like travel, but you need to get used to it as an elite athlete.
Driving tip
I learned from my driving teacher, who was also a bus driver at the time, to brake comfortably for your passengers.
Psychological tip
My coach always says ?there are no limits; keep your mind open to allow you to reach peak performance?. I know between the European Championships in Amsterdam last year and the Rio Olympics I had to keep a very positive mindset because I picked up and injury, which restricted my ability to train.
Vacation tip
I sat next to someone on a plane once, who said Croatia was a super-nice place to visit. I?ve yet to take him up on the advice, but one day I will do.
Social media tip
I think it is always important to give people the chance to look behind the scenes of what we do. Many people only see us in competition, but it is all the behind-the-scenes work, which makes our journey so interesting.
Parental tip
Think first and then act. That is how my parents raised me. Don?t rush into doing anything.
Dating tip
Everyone should follow their heart. Olympic shot put champion Ryan Crouser started his 2017 season where he left off in 2016. The American hurled the shot over 22 metres on four occasions in the same meet last month, setting a world-leading 22.15m mark. Here he shares some valuable advice. Better pay attention.
Championship tip
The biggest thing for performing at a major championship is preparation. If you have prepared well for a whole year and given your best in every single workout, then this will give you the confidence and ability to perform when it counts.
Another tip I would give for performing well at a major championship is to go through different scenarios in training. I visualise my last throw in training sessions as if it was the sixth round of a major championship and my last chance to win gold. This helps you perform under pressure.
It?s funny, my favourite throw used to be Ulf Timmermann?s Olympic record of 22.47m and I used to go through the scenarios with my father [and coach] of trying to beat it. So when I set an Olympic record of 22.52m [in Rio], in my mind I had already broken that record a thousand times.
Technical tip
I would say for younger athletes don?t move away from the glide [technique] too early as it teaches you the fundamentals and some elements that the spin [technique] tends to overlook.
I believe my success as a spinner is due in large part to being a glider for almost ten years.
Vacation tip
Make sure you get away from track and field in your vacation time. It is important to have that break and make sure you do something else during that time off that you really enjoy doing.
Coaching tip
It is important for athletes to figure out things on their own. A lot of my biggest technical breakthroughs have come on throwing days when I have thrown by myself. This has allowed me to understand better my throw on a personal level.
Tip for surviving the athletics circuit
The best thing for me has been keeping a travel journal. In this I record the days when I have travelled. When I have felt good and bad, what I?d done training-wise, how my body has responded to the flight, how much food and water I need and what I need in terms of sleep the night I arrive.
For example, for me personally, by keeping the journal I know travelling backwards in time works better for my body. Driving tip
Get a little practice driving on the other side of the road! I have recently been to New Zealand to compete and I had a steep learning curve driving on the left-hand side of the road.
Cooking tip
I cook a lot and I?m always trying to gain weight. For me, it is all about a fast and easy meal that is relatively healthy and in large portions!
Top tip from parents
They always motivated me to set goals. This was not always about setting the ?Holy Grail? in terms of goals, but about setting goals daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and even setting goals in the longer term. I guess this also taught me the importance of learning that everything comes in a certain order.
Psychological tip
I?m a big fan of visualisation. Every night when I?m lying in bed, I normally visualise six throws in my head. Each one I would try to do as close to perfection as possible and each one better than the other.
Visualising in your mind can help you achieve your goals when it comes to competing.
Fashion tip
Always wear comfortable clothes when travelling. It?s nice to be comfortable when travelling rather than dressing too fashionably.
Social media tip
I?m not that big on Twitter or Facebook, but I like Instagram. I would say, if you want to grow followers post daily and post things that are relevant. Don?t try and be something you?re not. Be true to yourself.
Dating tip
I?ve been in a relationship for a couple of years, so I?m out of the game a bit, but try to find somebody who makes you happy and you make them happy. I see lots of people in relationships or on dates with people who clearly aren?t for them. I would also say, don?t be afraid to be single as it is important to figure out who you are as well.  Michelle Carter achieved a lifelong ambition in the women's shot put at the 2016 Rio Olympics, unleashing a throw of 20.63m in the final round to take gold. Seven months on from that historic night, the American shares her top tips for life in and out of the throwing circle.
Championship tip
The people may change, the venue may change but the ring, shot and track stay the same. It was my dad (Michael Carter, the 1984 Olympic men?s shot put silver medallist) who first told me this. I would put pressure on myself because it was a championship. But the facts are facts. The shot is the same and the ring is the same. At championship time, I should treat it no differently.
Tactical tip
Set your end goals, then set small goals as your plan to attack your main goal. Over the years I noticed when I set small goals it felt like I accomplished more than when I was purely focusing on the big goal and not making it. I would feel defeated. But having multiple check points and checking them off the list helps motivate me to keep going, because that way I?m making progress.
Psychological tip
Positive self-talk ? you have to build yourself up by speaking positively about you to yourself. The Bible says: the words of the reckless pierce like swords, but the tongue of the wise brings healing. (Proverbs 12.18) I believe it?s true, so why would I pierce myself? The definition of insanity is to do the same thing and expect different results. I decided that I am not insane and I needed to change my words to bring healing to myself and build myself up.
Coaching tip
You have to trust your coach [Carter is coached by her father, Michael]. There were times I didn?t trust my dad because I couldn?t see the big picture. As I started to understand what was going on and seeing the results I learned to trust him. He is in charge of the big picture while I attack what?s right in front me.  Technical tip
Remember the basics. The power comes from the legs ? my dad always told me that. In fact, I always remember one to three basic terms that are my go-to when I?m frustrated.
Top tip for surviving the circuit
Always be on time for your flights and bring snacks ? beef and turkey jerky, peanut butter and chips and some of my favourites ? because you will get hungry. I have missed two flights and I had to pay for them. I don?t ever want to do that again; it?s expensive!
Cooking tip
A little butter never hurt anyone!
Top parental tip
They actually know stuff. Listen to what they have to say. One day it will come in handy. I?ve had friends that my parents may have said I should be careful of. I didn?t listen and they ended up hurting me. I didn?t think my parents knew what they talking about, but they did. I should have listened or moved with caution.
Fashion tip
Spend money on timeless classic pieces. Be selective about the trendy pieces. Timeless and classic never goes out of style.
Driving tip
Remember to get home ALIVE! Drive for yourself and everyone on the road.
Vacation tip
When you take a vacation make sure you put your phone down. I have learned to put my phone down because it is hard to engage when you are looking down at your phone. I want the people or person I am with to have my full attention and I want their full attention.
Social media tip
Do not post when you are emotional. Write it down on paper first then you can collect your thoughts before you post.
Dating tip
Date someone that you can be friends with first. If you have a strong friendship you will have a strong foundation for a relationship. Scores of athletes could be stripped of their world records under new proposals from European Athletics.
The governing body only wants records to be recognised if they can stand up to strict new criteria, part of attempts to make a clean break with the sport's doping scandals.
As a result, any records set before 2005 are now at risk - almost half of the 146 men's and women's indoor and outdoor records. These include marks that have never been subject to suspicion, prompting an outcry from many of the existing record holders.
Seven of the eight men's field events world records and the women's 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m marks could go.
Olympic champions including Florence Griffith-Joyner, Michael Johnson, Hicham El Guerrouj and Jonathan Edwards will fall off the world record list on to an 'all-time list' if the proposals are ratified by the the sport's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), in August.
Meanwhile, athletes who have competed after 2005 may soon find themselves with a 'WR' next to their name if the sport's record achievements are - in the words of IAAF chief Lord Coe - "recalibrated".
European Athletics taskforce apologises to GB athletes over world records
European Athletics proposes rewriting athletics world records after doping scandal Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m, set in 1995, is among the long-standing records under threat.
The Olympic, world and European champion jumped into the history books at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg as he became the first man to pass the 18-metre mark. American Christian Taylor, who jumped 18.21m in August 2015, would in all likelihood be promoted to world record holder.
Long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe set a world record of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds in the 2003 London Marathon using two male pacemakers. Her record would be taken by this year's London winner Mary Keitany, who finished in 2:17:01.
Welsh hurdler Colin Jackson set the indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs in 1994, and Britain can still lay claim - for now - to the 4x200m indoor relay record of 1:21.11, set in Glasgow in 1991 by a team that included Linford Christie, who won Olympic 100m gold the following year. American sprinter Griffith-Joyner, also known as Flo Jo, won three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
The former world champion, who died aged 38 in 1998, still holds the 100m and 200m world records. She ran 10.49secs at the US Olympic trials at the University at Indianapolis in July 1988 and then two months later set the 200m world record of 21.34secs at the Games in South Korea.
Fellow American Carmelita Jeter would potentially move up from second on the all-time 100m list with her 2009 time of 10.64secs.
The European Athletics proposals include scrapping the records of anyone caught doping, even if the record was set outside the time period in which they were proven to be cheating. That could mean Dutch sprinter Dafne Schippers taking the new 200m record with her time of 21.63secs set in 2015. She is currently third on the list but drug cheat Marion Jones' legal time of 21.62secs from 1998 would also be removed from the books.
Hicham El Guerrouj One of the biggest casualties from the rule change could be Moroccan middle-distance runner El Guerrouj, who stands to lose five world records.
The 42-year-old, who is a double Olympic champion and four-time world champion, is the current 1500m, one mile and 2,000m record holder.
In 1998, in Rome, El Guerrouj broke the 1500m record with a run of three minutes 26 seconds. In 1999, also in Rome, he set a new mark for the mile with a time of 3:43.13 and then later that season he set a new 2,000m record of 4:44.79 minutes in Berlin.
El Guerrouj also holds the indoor 1500m and mile world records, which he set in 1997.
His 1500m mark would go to Kenya's Olympic champion Asbel Kiprop, who would move up from third on the list with a 2015 time that was only 0.69 seconds behind El Guerrouj's record.
More dramatically, American Alan Webb could jump from eighth on the all-time list for the mile to take the record with a time from 2007 that is more than three seconds slower than El Guerrouj's mark.
Australian Craig Mottram would take the 2,000m world record with his time from 2006 of 4:50.76, despite being 10th on the all-time list.
Mike Powell American long jumper Mike Powell, a two-time world champion, set his record of 8.95m 26 years ago at the 1991 Tokyo World Championships, breaking the existing record by five centimetres - Bob Beamon's legendary leap from the Mexico City Olympics that had itself stood for 23 years.
With Powell and Beamon's jumps chalked off and nine-time gold medallist Carl Lewis' jump of 8.87m from 1991 also not eligible, the record would most likely go to another American, Dwight Phillips, who would move up from fifth with his 2009 leap of 8.74m.
Jan Zelezny Three-time Olympic javelin champion Jan Zelezny, a rival of Britain's Steve Backley, threw 98.48m in Germany in 1996. His world record is still more than five metres further than the second best throw of all time. Kenya's Julius Yego currently has the third best of all time but his 92.72m throw in 2015 would be in line to take top spot under the new criteria.
Michael Johnson Four-time Olympic gold medallist Johnson has already lost his 200m world record to Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt and his 400m mark to South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk and could be about to lose a third.
Johnson was part of the US team that ran a time of 2:54.39 in the 4x400m relay at the 1993 World Championships. Harry Reynolds, Andrew Valmon and Quincy Watts made up the quartet.
Kenenisa Bekele Ethiopian long-distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is a three-time Olympic and five-time world champion and also the 5,000m and 10,000m record holder. It's the former record that he might soon lose as his time of 12:37.55 was set in May 2004. It would go to countryman Dejen Gebremeskel who is fifth on the existing list with 12:46.81, nine seconds off Bekele's record.
Who else could become a new record holder?
American Sanya Richards-Ross would take one of the most controversial records, the women's 400m. That was set in 1985 at 47.60 seconds by Marita Koch, who competed for the former East Germany.
The next four athletes on the current list, including Sydney Olympic champion Cathy Freeman, who ran her best time at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, would also be erased from the record books, leaving Richards' 48.70 as the best time. Only three other runners in the top 20 set their time after 2005 - Allyson Felix in Beijing in 2015 (49.26), Russia's Yuliya Gushchina (49.28) in 2012 and her compatriot Antonina Krivoshapka (49.16) in 2012 - and Krivoshapka was this year revealed to have tested positive for steroid turinabol during the re-examination of samples from London 2012.
Kevin Young is the only man to have run the 400m hurdles in under 47 seconds. His winning time of 46.78secs at the 1992 Olympics could be replaced by fellow American Kerron Clement's 47.24 set in June 2005.
Only two women have broken into the top 20 times in the women's 800m since 2005, and if Jarmila Kratochv?lova of the former Czechoslovakia loses her 1983 record of 1:53.28, Kenya's Pamela Jelimo, third on the list, would be promoted with her 2008 time of 1:54.01.
American Jackie Joyner-Kersee's heptathlon points record of 7,291 from her Olympic gold-medal performance in Seoul in 1988 would be replaced by Carolina Kluft's 7,032 points from 2007. Britain's Jessica Ennis-Hill is currently third on the list. All athletics world records set before 2005 could be rewritten under a "revolutionary" new proposal from European Athletics.
The credibility of records was examined following the sport's doping scandal.
Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals "cowardly".
"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity," she said, adding that the governing bodies had "again failed clean athletes".
Svein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records "are meaningless if people don't really believe them".
However, Radcliffe said the changes were "heavy handed" and "confusing to the public".
European Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in January. Its ruling council has now ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants the sport's world governing body, the IAAF, to adopt the changes it sets out. How will world records be recognised?
If the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:
It was achieved at a competition on a list of approved international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment can be guaranteed;
The athlete had been subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to it;
The doping control sample taken after the record was stored and available for re-testing for 10 years.
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an "all-time list", but not be officially recognised as records.
This would include Jonathan Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Colin Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon mark of two hours 15 minutes and 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.
Mary Keitany of Kenya broke Radcliffe's women's-only world record to win the 2017 London Marathon in two hours 17 minutes one second, the second-fastest time in history.
The council also recommended that a performance should be wiped from record books if the athlete had committed a "doping or integrity violation, even if it does not directly impact the record performance".
Why are the changes needed?
The proposals are a response to last year's McLaren report, which uncovered widespread doping in sport - and athletics in particular. Russian athletes are currently banned from international competition unless they can satisfy strict criteria to show they are clean.
More than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.
"There are records in which people in the sport, the media and the public do not have complete confidence," added taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.
What has the reaction been so far? IAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were "a step in the right direction".
"There will be athletes, current record holders, who will feel that the history we are recalibrating will take something away from them, but if organised and structured properly we have a good chance of winning back credibility in this area," he said.
European Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting.
"What we are proposing is revolutionary and not just because most world and European records will have to be replaced," Hansen added.
"We want to raise the standards for recognition to a point where everyone can be confident that everything is fair and above board." Radcliffe's statement in full
Radcliffe has previously criticised plans to wipe records from the books and last month told BBC Sport she favoured making doping a criminal offence instead to deter cheats.
She issued a statement on Monday criticising the new proposals and athletics governing bodies.
"I worked extremely hard for my PBs and they will always be valid to me. I know they were set through hard work and best effort and abiding by all the rules and am proud of them," Radcliffe wrote.
"Governing bodies have a duty to protect every clean athlete, here they again fail those athletes. We had to compete against cheats, they couldn't provide us a level playing field, we lost out on medals, moments and earnings due to cheats, saw our sport dragged through the mud due to cheats and now, thanks to those who cheat we potentially lose our World and Area records.
"Although we are moving forward I don't believe we are yet at the point where we have a testing procedure capable of catching every cheat out there, so why reset at this point? Do we really believe a record set in 2015 is totally clean and one in 1995 not?
"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity. It is a heavy handed way to wipe out some really suspicious records in a cowardly way by simply sweeping all aside instead of having the guts to take the legal plunge and wipe any record that would be found in a court of law to have been illegally assisted.
"It is confusing to the public at a time when athletics already struggles to market itself. How do they explain how stadium, club and national records are better than the Area or World marks or will they force all those to be to wiped out too?"
 When Sir Roger Bannister ran one mile in under four minutes on 6 May 1954 it was hailed as a ground-breaking moment for sport.
His time of three minutes 59.4 seconds broke both psychological and physiological barriers.
Now, 63 years later, an attempt will be made to shatter another of sport's landmark times - a sub two-hour marathon.
Bannister's mile was a triumph of Corinthian values and spirit.
However, this marathon - to be run in under 120 minutes - is organised by sportswear giant Nike and the event, taking place in northern Italy on Saturday morning, has a distinctly corporate feel about it.
It is the ultimate endurance test, but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see.
So is it an expensive PR and marketing exercise?
Or, given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26.2 miles, should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights?
A place in history, but not the record books
The world record for the marathon was set by Kenya's Dennis Kimetto in Berlin in 2014. His time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours.
However, it will be not be Kimetto stepping up to this challenge. The job lies instead with his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia.
Kipchoge, as the reigning Olympic marathon champion, perhaps has the greatest chance. His personal best of 2:03.05, set in London in 2016, is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record.
To break the two-hour marathon barrier, a runner would need to beat the fastest-ever marathon by about 3%. That means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the race's 26.2 miles.
Therefore, to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement - something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible.
Nike don't really do perceived wisdom though.
They have signed up the three elite performers, paying them to forego the London and Berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded "Breaking2".
Historical weather patterns have been studied and a three-day window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions.
It has since been narrowed further and so, at 05:45 local time on Saturday morning, the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history, but not the record books.
This is because of the use of in-out pacemakers, 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level. Their use is against athletics regulations, so no matter what time is set on Saturday morning, it won't be considered a valid world record.
The pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds.
How are they trying to do this?
In-out pacemaking is just one facet of what is a complex and expensive operation.
According to Runners World magazine, several locations were scouted worldwide in search of the perfect venue.
Courses in the Netherlands, Chicago and Berlin are all said to have been considered and eventually rejected.
Monza, just north of Milan, is more used to hosting Formula 1 races but was finally chosen because of its gentle corners, climatic conditions and the fact it's both flat and 600ft above sea level. So 17.5 laps of a 2,400m course await.
Nike's legion of scientists, performance coaches, nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance. Mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners' legs, core temperature pills (an ingestible thermometer that transmits data) are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success.
Staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they don't waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables.
And then there's the runners' kit - or, more specifically, the shoes.
Nike says its own tests on a special new shoe - passed as legal by the International Association of Athletic's Federation's (IAAF) technical committee - make runners up to 4% more efficient.
'Transform a sport' - the marketing
So is the attempt just about selling very expensive shoes?
Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting; perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity.
But Nike's vice president of special projects, Sandy Bodecker, is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have, even if it is under such controlled conditions.
"The sub two-hour marathon barrier is one of those rare ones that, if broken, can transform a sport," he says.
"It's the last big, once-in-a-generation barrier? It will impact the way runners view distance running and human potential forever."
It's a big claim but, very much in line with a company ethos that urges elite athletes and park plodders alike to "Just Do It."
Others, however, are critical of the attempt given the money-no-object resources that have been thrown at it and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record.
Is media presence a distraction?
The attempt is also notable in that the world's media are being blocked from witnessing it. This is very much a behind-closed-doors event, which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by.
There will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of Formula 1 tifosi on race days.
It suggests that, with everything else under tight control, spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand. The very early start time, no doubt, presents logistical issues too.
Instead, Nike have allowed a few hand-picked journalists to attend who have also covered the build-up to the big day. A web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track.
Some supporters of the project have called it a "moonshot", given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point.
So, just like Neil Armstrong's famous first step on the lunar surface in 1969, the world will be required to watch and wonder.
Analysis - the man, not the shoes
BBC athletics commentator Ed Harry
Amid the furore over proposals to not call anything pre-2005 a world record, there's some irony that we can get so excited about a race where a world record can't be set.
Saturday 6 May is the preferred date, which is also the 63rd anniversary of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute barrier for the mile.
There are definite parallels. There was plenty of controversy about Bannister's attempt, just as there is about what's happening in Monza.
But an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been. If anyone can do this, it's Eliud Kipchoge.
But that still means him running more than three minutes faster than his current best. The man, not the shoes nor the science, will have to find most of that.
If you want to start running but feel nervous about doing it on your own, RunTogether could be the answer.
A new national programme set up by England Athletics, RunTogether aims to motivate people to improve their physical and mental health by running with others.
By simply logging on to the website, you'll have access to local running groups which offer fun, organised jogs and runs with other people, with qualified group leaders.
The website also includes access to marked running routes specific to your area, searchable using your postcode. Trying to start running can be a daunting task, as Sam Mollaghan - the face of the This Girl Can Run campaign, and a qualified Run Leader - understands.
"When I started running a couple of years ago, I was very self-conscious about how others would perceive me," she said. "So I empathise with how many runners feel anxious when running alone.
"Now I'm a Run Leader, I'm able to help others enjoy the benefits that regular running in a group has to offer - it's such a great way to improve fitness and socialise at the same time.
"I'm also more confident when I run, as I know I'm doing something that benefits my health and mindset. I've made some great friends in running groups and would encourage as many people to join their local group." Runners are also being encouraged to take photos and tag which friends and celebrities they would like to run with, using #RunTogether.
Matt Birkett, head of running participation at England Athletics, said: "We know that running with others is more effective in changing behaviour, making people more likely to sustain a running habit, and we know how much of an impact running has on improving emotional health and well-being.
"We want to get one million more people into regular athletics and running by 2021, and ensure that everyone in England has access to a local RunTogether group across the country." Unparalleled levels of success for his country's competitors have been predicted by Scottish Athletics' performance director Roger Harkins.
Laura Muir won two gold medals, Eilish McColgan a bronze and Eilidh Doyle a relay silver at the European Indoor Championships over the weekend.
"People hark back to the halcyon days of the 1970s and 1980s," Harkins said.
"I genuinely believe Scottish athletics is moving into an era where it will be unprecedented."
And he added: "If it continues along this vein then it will definitely be the best it has ever been.
"There are so many talented athletes about at the moment - Eilish, Laura, Steph Twell, Andy Butchart, Callum Hawkins, Lynsey Sharp to name but a few.
"We've got some good throwers as well and we've got some good kids coming through in the sprints and endurance events."
Muir won the 1500m and 3,000m, with McColgan finishing third in the latter, while Doyle was part of Britain's 4x400m relay squad.
Harkins believes such successes are not only inspiring their colleagues but "a new generation of kids coming through". "If you go back 10 years, there would only be a couple of Scottish athletes in the GB team and those athletes have inspired a generation of the next athletes," he told BBC Scotland.
"It was unprecedented that we have 15 athletes at the Olympics in Rio last year and six athletes at the Paralympics."
However, Harkins did not anticipate increased government funding as a result.
"I find that hard to imagine in the current economic climate, particularly when they are talking about cuts across the board," he said.
"We can only hope that, if athletics is doing well, our money will not be cut."
Meanwhile, Harkins believes Muir, who plans to double up again at this year's World Championships, could go on to become one of Scotland's greatest-ever athletes.
"She certainly has the ability and the characteristics for that," he said while praising the hard work put in by the 25-year-old and her coach.
"She's had this potential for a number of years, but to deliver the performances that she did and the manner in which she did them over the weekend is absolutely amazing.
"It is great credit to the work Andy Young has been doing with her." Former European medallist Lee McConnell thinks that Muir is already among Scotland's all-time best.
"She's a fantastic athlete," she said. "The future's really bright for Laura.
"I think the biggest thing for her is that she needs to keep training the way she's training and try her best not to pick up any injuries.
"She didn't come back with a medal from Rio, but she was still outstanding on the athletics circuit with such quick times over 1500m.
"True Laura style, she went out in Rio to win the gold medal and I think, if she had decided she was happy with silver or bronze, she would have probably come back with a silver or bronze.
The European Indoor Championships is a great chance for her and I know there has been some talk about her doubling up over 1,500m and 5,000m, both indoors and outdoors, this season. I am not sure whether Laura has actually said that is what she definitely wants to do, rather she has said the schedule allows it, which is a little bit different.
The very fact that she is talking about it though shows she is obviously not setting her targets low, which is great. You don't win things by not thinking big. Laura has always struck me as quite quiet but she has never lacked confidence. I've seen her train quite a lot over the last few years - she doesn't have very many easy days.
Training in the bank
To be fair there aren't many easy days for anyone out here. Our group mainly consists of 800 or 1500m runners, with the likes of Laura Weightman and Kyle Langford also in the group.
This is a crucial time of year for them to get the endurance base that will carry them through the summer. It's a bit of a departure for us from recent years in that we have come to South Africa rather than Iten in Kenya. Iten is about 8,000 ft, while Potch is more like 4,000ft. Being at a slightly lower altitude means you can do a bit more quality work while still getting the benefit of being at altitude. The food is better too.
Athletics in transition
British athletics will have a hard act to follow in the coming years. With Jessica Ennis-Hill having retired and Mo Farah having talked about 2017 being his last track season, we are going to go through a bit of a transition. It's a big two years or so.
At the World Championships in London we'll still be talking about the same athletes as the last few years, like Mo and Greg Rutherford, in terms of medals. But in the next couple of years there is a huge opportunity for some of the younger ones to get into the medal mix.
The athletes then sleep in altitude tents at night to get that added benefit too. The benefits of altitude are not a new thing to me - I wrote my dissertation about its benefits back in 1981 and I used to use it by training in Colorado during my career - and in many ways the sport is very similar to when I did it.
There is a lot more science behind everything now and the level of support athletes get with a physiologist, physiotherapist, nutritionist etc is very different but in essence running is very straightforward. I trained hard and they train hard.

Tom Bosworth is one of those athletes in the race walk. On a broader level I do feel that athletics is in a pretty good place. The work that has been done and is ongoing regarding the drugs issue has given people a bit of an uplift. The issue of performance-enhancing drugs will never go away completely of course but Tom is one of those athletes who has been incentivised by the ban on Russia, who have been a dominant force in the race walks.
After his performance in Rio, where he finished sixth, Tom is now on the highest level of funding and wants to learn how to win a medal in future years. That is not a situation you would have expected for a British race walker a few years ago.
Mo has nothing to worry about
Mo has made a habit of winning at a canter for a number of years now but I wasn't overly concerned about his defeat at the Great Edinburgh Cross Country. He knew he wasn't expecting to win but he showed there just why he is a champion - because he cares.
I thought he did a good job. He was 12th at one point and he could have run around at 90% from then on and come 11th. He chose not to and ended seventh. I thought it was really telling that he refused to stop giving it everything. He didn't know where he was at ahead of Edinburgh - now he knows exactly where he is and what he's got to do.
The London World Championships might seem a long way from South Africa in mid-January but the hard work starts now?
"But she went for gold and, at that stage, it didn't pay off.
European Athletics set up a taskforce to look into the credibility of world records in January.
Its ruling council has ratified the proposals put forward by the taskforce, and it wants world governing body the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) to back them when its council meets in August.
Taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan told BBC Sport on Tuesday the plans were about "restoring credibility".
"Obviously this has to stand up to a court of law," he added.
"This is about the sport regaining control of its rules and records. Because in the past there have been threats of legal action when this has been mooted."
Asked whether more legal challenges were expected, he said: "No, we've just changed the rules of the sport. These are sports rules. It would be like somebody challenging the referee in a football game."
IAAF President Lord Coe has called for a "global debate" around the issue, telling BBC London: "It's important that we have these discussions.
"These proposals will come back to the council and I look forward to maybe counter proposals and maybe changes, maybe thoughts around it.
"We have to start somewhere. This is a debate the athletes have prompted the administrators to have for far too long."
Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, has called the proposals "cowardly".
However, fellow British runner Darren Campbell says the move would be "for the greater good".
Powell set the long jump world record at the 1991 World Championships in Tokyo, beating Bob Beamon's mark of 8.90m, which had led the field for 23 years.
Twenty-six years on, only the discus throw (1986), the hammer throw (1986) and shot put (1990) world records have stood for longer in men's outdoor athletics.
Retirement is supposed to signal a full-stop. The end of one life, the start of another. A sense of satisfaction, a sense of closure.
There should be no limbo. But for Goldie Sayers - the 11-time British javelin champion and three-time Olympian who announced the conclusion of her athletics career on Wednesday - the wondering and "what ifs" will follow her into the future.
After eight years of waiting, Sayers was told in September that she was being retrospectively awarded Olympic bronze from the 2008 Beijing Games. Mariya Abakumova, the Russian who had finished second and who Sayers had always suspected of cheating, had failed a doping retest for a banned steroid.
Sayers, now 34, celebrated with a coffee in Waitrose with her mother, Liz. And then the limbo began: Abakumova appealing against her disqualification, the legal process slowing to a crawl, no medal in the post and no idea of when any of it will end.
"Initially I was just really happy," explained Suffolk-born Sayers. "I'd been chasing something that had eluded me and then all of a sudden, driving down the M11, I had it.
"But actually now I'm much angrier about it - and I'm not an angry person at all. There's a deep sense of injustice.
"I was desperate to draw a line under my career and move on because I think endings are important - but at this rate I'll be drawing my pension before I get an Olympic medal."
Sayers is not alone. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has now caught 111 athletes with retrospective tests from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, a welcome epidemic of late justice that has brought with it its own chaotic tail.
Because so many of those who fail retests routinely appeal to the Court for Arbitration for Sport (Cas), regardless of evidence or ethics, those clean athletes promoted in their wake are left somewhere between regret, exasperation and hope: swindled out of their defining sporting moment, denied the financial rewards that a medal would have brought, left hanging by a system that is stumbling towards a cleaner future while trying to mop up the mess of the past.
"It's all about the moment for me," says Sayers, now 34. "None of the other stuff that would have come with it - sponsorship, profile, the actual medal itself - matters in the same way.
"I'd love to be able to transport myself back to standing on an Olympic podium, but I won't ever be able to do that. You have had the greatest moment of your life stolen from you.
"Javelin is literally one moment. The whole of my run-up took 4.45 seconds, the throw itself took 18 hundredths of a second, 80% of my speed of release came from the last hundredth of a second.
"When your timing is right, and you're mentally and physically at one with your javelin, time effectively stands still. Those moments become exaggerated. The whole world makes sense in that instant.
"If you've seen the film Limitless - where Bradley Cooper takes a pill and the whole world slows down, and he can problem solve and make things happen - that's what javelin feels like when your timing is on.
"That's what you miss: the flow through your body, everything separating and moving as one. I miss time standing still.
"And it's about sharing that moment with other people. I remember celebrating what I knew was a personal best and British record, over the road from the Bird's Nest stadium. My mum, a family friend who'd come over to support, my coach Mark, Steve Backley and his mentor John Trower, Seb Coe. There were a lot of people in that hotel bar.
"Sharing that moment with all of them, that nearly moment, I was excited, and there was a sense of pride of seeing a plan through. But it would have been incredible, I know, if I had been standing there celebrating as an Olympic medallist - because it would have meant so much to all those people, not just me."
There are nine British athletes from the 2008 Olympics in this strange purgatory: the men's 4x400m relay squad of Andrew Steele, Robert Tobin, Michael Bingham and Martyn Rooney; the women's 4x400m team of Christine Ohuruogu, Kelly Sotherton, Marilyn Okoro and Nicola Sanders; and Sayers.
Sotherton, who retired five years ago, is owed two medals - one from the relay, one from the heptathlon, where she initially finished fifth before retrospective bans removed Lyudmila Blonska of Ukraine and Russia's Tatyana Chernova.
No-one knows when those medals will arrive, or how - prosaically, in the post, as some have in the past, or awarded at a special ceremony at a future athletics meet, maybe this summer's World Championships in London, although that is not an IOC event. Maybe much later, if Cas' procedures drift on and on.
It is clearly preferable to those retests never having been done, and those cheats never being caught. But it is a flawed process, just as with the proposal to scratch all track and field world records recorded before 2005, clean athletes seemingly punished again for the crimes of those who defrauded them in the first place.

GB record holders are 'collateral damage'
The winners and losers if records are wiped
Cram: Proposals are disrespectful to clean athletes
"It's a strange place to be," said Sayers. "It would be nice for legal processes to be sped up after someone is caught, because everyone needs to move on. There are going to be more and more athletes who've retired, picking up Olympic medals, thinking, 'If only?'
"It's getting on. Some of the kids I'm coaching don't even remember those Olympics.
"You very quickly feel like a has-been in sport. And I don't want to be one of those people talking about something that happened 20 years ago, and that being the best moment of their life."
Abakumova was something of an open secret in Beijing. Her physique had changed dramatically over the previous winter, and her distances followed suit: 61.43 metres at the Worlds in 2007, a jump to 70.78m in Beijing.
Sayers' British record of 65.75m was only 38 centimetres off the initial bronze. It would also have been good enough for silver at the two subsequent Olympics. It should have brought satisfaction.
"I remember having to compose myself afterwards and have a series of press interviews where I couldn't say that I'd just been cheated out of an Olympic medal," she said.
"Instead I had to say that it was a surprise that someone had improved five metres, and that the champion nearly had to break the world record to win.
"It's weird thinking about it now. We would all joke about Russian athletes, and some others, doping. We just had to accept that they were cheating.
"I had initially tried to remain naive about it, partly because I didn't feel at my own physical or mental peak. I thought, if they're doping they should be throwing further.
"When you feel you're not throwing as far as you could, you just get on with it. But when you feel like you really have, that's when it hits you: hang on, this really isn't right.
"I had a conversation with Kelly in the Olympic village in Beijing. I said, 'At least everyone was drug tested, so in a few years, who knows, we might be Olympic medallists.' Because it was just so obvious. So brutally obvious.
"It's great now that people can openly talk about it. Maybe we were all complicit, because we didn't talk about it in those interviews. But you had no concrete evidence, and so you had no way of policing your own sport. You just had to get on with it."
Sayers still loves athletics. She has started her own coaching and mentoring website, Javelin Champ, and will be Team GB's deputy chef de mission at the 2017 European Youth Olympic Festival.
"Oh no, don't ask me that question! Um? it's really hard," she said.
"When I was first given a javelin to take home over the school Easter holidays I never thought, I'll make a living out of this, go to three Olympics, break the British record. I only thought, how far can I throw this?
"You become addicted to progress. As long as you keep improving, you keep going.
"I've beaten people who have been caught cheating. And there are always things you can improve. It just makes it a lot harder to beat them.
"The biggest problem with doping is that it pushes people who are clean into getting injured. That was my experience. I was guilty of pushing too hard in training, trying to make up the gap. I had seven operations in the eight years after Beijing.
"I would still do it. But I wouldn't want to know what I know now, because then I wouldn't have given everything to it. And I wouldn't want to be an athlete who didn't give everything to it. I did."
As Sayers prepares to say farewell to that competitive career, she displays little of the bitterness you might expect. She is honest about her own mistakes, hopeful about what might come next for athletics, open to being astonished by remarkable performances rather than cynical.
"You don't want people thinking everyone is cheating, because they honestly aren't," she added. "There aren't as many cheats as the cynics think there are. It's absolutely possible to make massive improvement in sport, because there are so many facets to it. Good coaching is the biggest performance-enhancer there is.
"But I do hope that announcing I've retired can be a line in the sand for me. I've wanted to do it for months, but I kept always thinking this legal process would be wrapped up, and I could look forward to a presentation."
She laughs. "On a positive, if the medal comes, I'll definitely do something. A retirement and medal party. Get together my family, my friends, my coaches, all my support team, and have a party.
"Everyone can dance round the medal, instead of their handbags. I'll probably have about 10 years to plan it, the way things are going, but still."
If you want to start running but feel nervous about doing it on your own, RunTogether could be the answer.
A new national programme set up by England Athletics, RunTogether aims to motivate people to improve their physical and mental health by running with others.
By simply logging on to the website, you'll have access to local running groups which offer fun, organised jogs and runs with other people, with qualified group leaders.
The website also includes access to marked running routes specific to your area, searchable using your postcode.
Runners are also being encouraged to take photos and tag which friends and celebrities they would like to run with, using #RunTogether.
Matt Birkett, head of running participation at England Athletics, said: "We know that running with others is more effective in changing behaviour, making people more likely to sustain a running habit, and we know how much of an impact running has on improving emotional health and well-being.
"We want to get one million more people into regular athletics and running by 2021, and ensure that everyone in England has access to a local RunTogether group across the country."
More than 250,000 people entered their name into the London Marathon 2017 ballot. Some were running to beat their best time, some dressed as animals, cartoon characters and even London buses, and some just hoped to cross the finish line still standing.
But practically everyone whose name was pulled out of the ballot this year had one thing in common. They were running to raise money for a charity or organisation that means something to them.
From dealing with mental health problems, living with life-changing medical conditions or overcoming traumatic circumstances - we talk to seven individuals who were 'Running for a Reason' on Sunday, 23 April.
Haroon, 31, first ran the London Marathon in 2012. After what he described as a "painful and exhausting experience", he vowed never to do it again.
But that all changed four years ago, when his father was suddenly killed in a car crash. Haroon wants to honour his dad, who was always striving to make life better for others.
Running shoes back on, and determined to make his dad proud, Haroon decided to take on the mammoth mission of completing four marathons in one month.
"He is my motivation and I'm determined to make this challenge a success,"
When Mike Kiff sustained a serious shoulder injury while on tour with the Army in Afghanistan, he was medically discharged after more than 16 years of service. He suffered with adjustment disorder and depression, which both he and his family found painful and debilitating.
Seeing her husband suffering both physically and mentally, wife Linda struggled to stay positive for their two young children and she too suffered from depression.
The Royal British Legion provided the couple with respite and counselling at a recovery centre in Germany. When Linda started running to clear her mind, she found the exercise extremely therapeutic. She lost four stone, felt happier and healthier, and Mike - admiring his wife's new-found optimism - wanted to follow in her footsteps.
"When I saw how running was helping Linda lose weight and cope better with her own depression, I wanted to see if it would work for me too," Mike said. "Sure enough it did. I managed to wean myself off antidepressants in about two months."
They ran the London Marathon to raise money for the charity that helped their family rebuild their lives. "Thanks to the Legion, I was finally able to deal with the situation. I don't know what I'd have done without them," he added.
"We're doing something we love, that makes us feel better, while raising money for the charity that provided support for us when we needed it the most."
Target sponsorship: At least ?2,000
Finish time: 5:37:15 (Linda registered as a second faster!)
Whether you're running an international championship race or out for a weekly jog, we all have a reason to run.
In London Marathon week, BBC Sport is launching the #IRunFor campaign for the 2017 summer of athletics.
The event mixes local runners with some of the world's best, all tackling the same course for their own reasons.
It could be to win, for a personal best, for donations or awareness of a cause. The #IRunFor campaign will focus on their stories and reasons they run.
The London Marathon, which will be live on BBC One on Sunday, 23 April, is the first in an action-packed summer of athletics.
The Great Manchester Run, Great North Run, Great Scottish Run and Cardiff Half Marathon are just some of the other mass-participation events that will be covered by the BBC and feature in the #IRunFor campaign.
The campaign will carry on across the World Athletics and Para Athletics Championships and beyond.
As well as hearing from you, the campaign will also ask elite athletes participating in the Manchester City Games, World Para Athletics and World Championships what their motivation is.
So, the next time you are pounding the streets think about why you do it, and be ready because we'll be asking you to be part of our #IRunFor campaign very soon.
And if you have good reasons but still haven't managed to take up running, we've got a guide to help you start.
Two amateur runners who provided the defining image of this year's London Marathon will be reunited at the upcoming Great Manchester Run.
Matthew Rees of Wales stopped 300 metres from the end to help Englishman David Wyeth, who was struggling with exhaustion, over the line.
"It'll be great to see David again - in happier circumstances," said Rees.
The pair will compete in the 10k event, which is broadcast live on BBC One, on Sunday, 28 May.
The two men had never met before April's London Marathon, but have communicated regularly since Rees generously stopped for Wyeth, who is from Manchester.
The pair eventually finished in two hours 52 minutes 26 seconds - with Rees losing scores of places in the race running order to come 986 in the men's overall.
Rees said he was just lending a hand to a "guy in need", but his actions drew praise from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, race officials and many social media users.
Plans to rewrite world records set before 2005 are "disrespectful, an injustice and a slap in the face", says former long jumper Mike Powell, who stands to lose his own world record.
The proposals by European Athletics are part of attempts to make a clean break with the sport's doping scandals.
If the move is approved, world records would only be recognised if they can stand up to strict new criteria.
But Powell, 53, told BBC World Service he would legally challenge any ruling.
"I've already contacted my attorney," said the American, whose mark of 8.95 metres set in August 1991 has never been bettered.
"There are some records out there that are kind of questionable, I can see that, but mine is the real deal. It's a story of human heart and guts, one of the greatest moments in the sport's history.
How will world records be recognised?
Which star names would lose out?
GB athletes are "collateral damage"
"They would be destroying so many things with this decision, without thinking about it. It's wrong. Regardless of what happens, I am going to fight."
Lord Coe, president of athletics' governing body the IAAF, called for a "global debate" around the issue.
He told BBC London: "These proposals will come back to the council and I look forward to maybe counter proposals and maybe changes, maybe thoughts around it.
"We have to start somewhere. This is a debate the athletes have prompted the administrators to have for far too long."
Former world and Olympic champion Sanya Richards-Ross says she backs proposals to rewrite world records - but that not all post-2005 bests will be clean.
Richards-Ross could inherit the 400m record, replacing the 47.60 seconds set by East Germany's Marita Koch in 1985.
The Jamaica-born American's time of 48.70 is the fastest since 2005.
And she told BBC World Service's Sportsworld programme that, should she be awarded the record, she "can vouch 100%" that it is clean.
Although Richards-Ross does not think all world records set after 2005 - the point from which, under European Athletics proposals, records would be reset - are clean, the 32-year-old said: "I think there's a better chance and a higher ratio of them being clean."
Marita Koch: Can we believe her 400m world record is genuine?
Koch competed during a time when it is known that East Germany was doping its athletes but she has denied any wrongdoing and never failed a drugs test.
However East German secret police documents, which detailed doping dosages of athletes including Koch, were made public in 1990.
Richard-Ross, who retired last year, said knowing this made her feel that the record was unobtainable.
"It's just not logical," said the Olympic 400m champion from London 2012. "Women were running 51 and 52 seconds prior to the 1980s and for that to drop to 47.60 just blows your mind.
"I always knew the 400m record was just so far out of reach and no matter how well or how hard I trained, or what shape I was in, I was never going to dip under 48 seconds."
Listen to the full interview with Sanya Richards-Ross in tomorrow's Sportsworld programme.
What is European Athletics proposing?
If the proposals put forward by athletics' European governing body are accepted by world body the IAAF, a world record would only be recognised if it met all three of the following criteria:
It was achieved at a competition on a list of approved international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment can be guaranteed;
The athlete had been subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to it;
The doping control sample taken after the record was stored and available for re-testing for 10 years.
The IAAF has stored blood and urine samples only since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an "all-time list", but not be officially recognised as records.
At the start of an important year in athletics - including this summer's World Championships in London - BBC Sport's lead commentator Steve Cram is in South Africa mentoring a group of British athletes during a training camp at altitude in Potchefstroom, two hours' drive from Johannesburg.
On paper a warm-weather training camp sounds like a bit of a jolly, but it's anything but for the British athletes over here at the minute.
We've got the South African football team the Kaiser Chiefs staying in the same accommodation as us and our athletes are definitely doing a lot more than those guys, that's for sure.
Most athletes are doing two sessions a day plus gym sessions, massage, nutritionist appointments - they are busy days. A meal out with a dessert every once in a while is their idea of a wild night out here in Potchefstroom.
Double trouble?
Double sessions bring me on to the discussion of Laura Muir. Laura has had a great start to the season with a British 5,000m record and she is looking great out here in South Africa.
She's at a really good place in her career but what she doesn't have yet is a major championship medal.
"Fair play to her - she feels she has a long future and there are other medals she can go for." From jogging to sprinting, or from marathons to taking the Couch to 5K challenge, running comes in many guises, and all of them will help get you fit.
The trick is to start off small and increase your distance and pace incrementally.
Stick to what makes you comfortable and remember that any distance is better than nothing at all! After battling with his bipolar, and attempting suicide "several times", Simon Lamb found that running was the best way to medicate himself. He later ran from 77 miles from London and Portsmouth.  
Manchester City held on to beat Leicester City and move back into third place after referee Bobby Madley disallowed Riyad Mahrez's late penalty for the Foxes.
Mahrez, who had been brought down by Gael Clichy, had the chance to make it 2-2 but slipped as he took his spot-kick and touched the ball with his right foot as well as his left as he sent it into the net.
Madley immediately ruled the goal out for a double-touch and awarded the home side a free-kick, to the relief of Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola and his players.
The hosts had dominated the first half at the Etihad Stadium, and looked like they were cruising to victory when they went 2-0 up.
Relive the game from the Etihad Stadium
There was controversy over the home side's first goal, which came when David Silva turned in Leroy Sane's shot, with Leicester claiming unsuccessfully that Raheem Sterling was offside as he tried and failed to help it over the line.
Gabriel Jesus made it 2-0 with a penalty that was a far easier decision for Madley, after Yohan Benalouane sent Sane sprawling.
Manchester City appeared to be in complete control but the mood changed when Leicester's Shinji Okazaki met Marc Albrighton's cross with a superb acrobatic finish.
Guardiola's side were far less fluent after the break while Leicester's increased attacking threat ensured a tense finish that almost brought them a point as a reward.
Top four within touching distance for City
Manchester City have now played the same amount of games as Liverpool, who need to win at West Ham on Sunday to go back above them.
Below them, any slip-ups by Arsenal at Stoke on Saturday evening or Manchester United at Tottenham on Sunday will mean Manchester City can make sure of a top-four finish, and Champions League football, by beating West Brom on Tuesday.
Leicester, who ensured top-flight survival with last week's win over Watford, can finish no higher than eighth.
The only tangible prize for last season's champions is Craig Shakespeare's long-term future as their manager, but they did not lack motivation against a side that stumbled over the line to collect three vital points on Saturday.
The atmosphere at the Etihad was undeniably edgy in the second half, even before Mahrez's slip let the home side off the hook.
Manchester City have lost only one league game on their own territory all season, but have drawn seven times and as Leicester threw players forward in the closing minutes in search of an equaliser, they were in real danger of being pegged back yet again.
Leicester do not get the draw they deserve
Mahrez's penalty slip was a bizarre denouement in a game where Leicester showed why they have caused Manchester City so many problems recently.
The Foxes thumped Guardiola's side 4-2 in December and also beat City at the Etihad Stadium last season with a landmark win on their way to the title.
Initially, Shakespeare's side were subdued and offered little more than the threat of Jamie Vardy's pace on the break, something they seldom managed to utilise.
But after Okazaki's spectacular strike brought them back into the game, Leicester sensed the anxiety of their hosts in the second half, pushed forward and put City under serious pressure.
After Albrighton miscued at the near post from a Vardy pull-back, Leicester did not have a clear-cut chance other than Mahrez's unfortunate spot-kick, but City keeper Willy Caballero and his defence had to deal with countless balls pumped into his area.
As BBC Radio 5 live pundit Chris Waddle said, the visitors probably deserved a draw in the end, but they leave Manchester empty handed this time.
Man of the match - Leroy Sane (Manchester City)
The German winger saw far less of the ball after the break but he was a huge threat down the left when his side were on top, setting up their first goal and winning the penalty that led to their second.
What next?
Manchester City have their final home game of the season against West Brom on Tuesday (20:00 BST), before ending their campaign at Watford on Sunday, 21 May (15:00).
Leicester finish with two games at the King Power Stadium - Tottenham are the visitors on Thursday (19:45), then Bournemouth on the final day (15:00).
Importance of Jesus - the stats
David Silva has scored in back-to-back Premier League games for the first time since December 2014.
Gabriel Jesus has been directly involved in seven goals in six Premier League starts [scoring five and assisting two].
The Brazilian has scored five times from seven shots on target in the Premier League for City.
Shinji Okazaki ended a run of 23 games in all competitions without scoring for Leicester.
No player has failed to score more penalties in the Premier League this season than Riyad Mahrez and Christian Benteke (two each).
Only referee Michael Oliver (15) has awarded more penalties in the Premier League this season than Bobby Madley (12).
Manchester City have lost just one of their past 15 Premier League games [won eight, drawn six].
Pep Guardiola named an unchanged line-up in a Premier League game for the first time.
Leicester have won one of 21 Premier League games this season in which they've conceded the first goal [drawn three, lost 17]. Tottenham Hotspur may have missed out on the league title, but it topped the house price tables

While they may not have won the U.K.?s Premier League, London soccer clubs dominated the rankings in terms of house price growth.
Of the 20 soccer clubs in the Premier League analyzed by global real estate consultancy Knight Frank, Tottenham Hotspur, who missed out narrowly on the title earlier this month, claimed the house price growth crown.
Average house prices in the area surrounding the White Hart Lane soccer stadium in Tottenham in north London jumped 18.4% last year. Prices could rise further if the area?s transport links are improved by a proposed rail link that would connect north and south London comes to fruition.
West Ham United, who will see their stadium redeveloped into a residential scheme as they move into the Olympic Stadium, saw the second highest price growth with a 13.2% increase.

In fact, Manchester City, whose players include the likes of Sergio Aguero, and Watford were the only clubs outside of London to appear in the top five. At the other end of the table was Swansea City in Wales, which saw house price growth of just 1.8%.
While prices rose by just 3.9% last year, properties around Stamford Bridge stadium in posh Chelsea in west London had the highest average house price around the ground at ?638,000.

Oliver Knight, a senior analyst at Knight Frank, said: ?The findings not only demonstrate the huge differences in value throughout the U.K., but also the variety of performance and prices within London, where sub-markets are moving at significantly different speeds.?
As for Leicester, which unexpectedly won the premiership league, its housing market has taken a long time to recover from the financial crisis and is just 1.2% higher than it was in 2007. But this could soon change thanks to the win.
Knight said: ?The local economy can expect a marginal boost following the Premier League win?as the profile of the city is raised and money from Europe?s elite football competition comes in.? The International Paralympic Committee is "greatly encouraged" by the progress being made by the organisers of the Tokyo 2020 Games.
The governing body completed a review in the Japanese capital on Thursday.
Only 12% of available tickets had been sold a month before the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games.
"The level of interest and awareness in the Games is like nothing we have experienced with three years still to go," said IPC chief Xavier Gonzalez.
"We have been captivated by the visibility of the Paralympic brand around the city."
Gonzalez added he was "confident" Tokyo 2020 could beat records for ticket sales set at London 2012, when one million tickets were sold in the first month they were available, with 2.85 million eventually sold. Britain's Jonny Brownlee crashed during the bike phase of his first triathlon since collapsing at last year's World Series finale.
Brownlee, who had to be carried over the line by brother Alistair in Mexico, was returning to action in Japan.
He carried his damaged bike a mile to the next transition in Yokohama to take part in the run and finished 42nd.
Spain's Mario Mola won the event, with Bermuda's Flora Duffy earlier winning the women's event.
"My first reaction was to get back on the bike, get back riding," said Brownlee.
"But then I got to my bike and the handlebars were pointing in the wrong direction and I couldn't move it.
"I still wanted to run - I had not come all the way to Japan not to finish."
Gordon Benson and Tom Bishop were the highest-placed British finishers in the men's race in 10th and 11th respectively.
The 2017 series is led by defending champion Mola from fellow Spaniard Fernando Alarza, who was also second to Mola in Japan.
Sophie Coldwell was the fastest Briton in the women's race as she came home fourth, one place ahead of compatriot Vicky Holland. Non Stanford, Jessica Learmonth and Lucy Hall were seventh, eighth and 11th respectively.
Stanford and Learmonth also crashed in the wet conditions but, unlike Brownlee, were able to remount.
In the Para-triathlon races, Britain won three gold medals, two silvers and two bronzes.
Andy Lewis was first in the PTS2 category, and Dave Ellis and his guide Jack Peasgood won the men's visually impaired race, while Alison Patrick and her guide Nicole Walters finished top of the standings in the women's equivalent.
Brownlee shows grit after crash
Brownlee, an Olympic silver medallist at Rio 2016 and a bronze medallist at London 2012, had missed the first two races of this year's World Series - in Australia and the United Arab Emirates.
In wet conditions in Yokohama he veered into the railings on his bike when trying to avoid a rider who had fallen in front of him.
Rather than concede his race was over, Brownlee ran barefoot for the final half-lap of the cycling discipline - about a mile - carrying his bike.
The 27-year-old eventually finished six minutes 56 seconds behind the winner.
"It was going quite well - the swim went really well," he said.
"On that course you want to stay high up in the field to avoid crashes. I was sitting in fourth to avoid crashes, but then an athlete just crashed in front of me.
"I was very, very lucky not to break anything in the crash. I've watched the video back and I could easily have two broken collarbones.
"I'm just disappointed - I come to races to race and I didn't get a chance."
The next race in the series takes place in Leeds, when Yorkshire-born Jonny could be joined by brother Alistair, who is focusing on long-distance triathlons this year.
You can watch highlights of the races on BBC Two from 13:00 BST on Sunday, 14 May.
Brownlee posted a picture of his bike following the race
Brendan Purcell, British Triathlon performance director, added: "The rain caught us by surprise. We were expecting rain, but it got heavier and heavier.
"When the guy went down in front of Jonny, he had nowhere to go. The bike couldn't be fixed, but he wanted to do a run as he feels he's in good form.
"I come away reflecting on the positives from the swim in particular, there were a lot of good performances. No-one had the perfect race, maybe apart from Sophie, but they delivered a set of solid results." There can be a time in anyone's life where they feel everything is going in the right direction and suddenly it all changes in one frightening moment.
Paralympian John Stubbs is Britain's most successful archer with a cabinet full of accolades including a Paralympic gold medal from 2008 and four world titles.
However, the 51-year-old has had to overcome a traumatic accident and battle mental health issues. It all started on 6 November 1989 - a date which would have more significance later in his triumphant archery career.
John Stubbs
Stubbs began participating in archery as a hobby after a life-changing accident in 1989, until he turned it into a career five years later
A life-saving hoax call
Aged 24, Stubbs was content with his situation in life as he travelled home on his motorbike from his dream job as a fabrication engineer to his young wife and newborn son in Warrington, Cheshire. But on a cold and dark evening, his world was turned upside down.
"Somebody in a car sideswiped me. I ended up landing in a farmer's field, not knowing at the time how bad my injuries were," Stubbs reflected.
"The driver had gone. My only thoughts were to get up and switch my bike off. But I couldn't. I crawled towards the bike on the edge of the road and the amount of pain I was in made me pass out."
His ordeal was not over, though.
John Stubbs
Stubbs was crowned a Paralympic champion with the British archery team in 2008 at the Beijing Paralympics
"Another car ran me over while I was down. They couldn't see me on the road," he adds. "But the next person to see me was a female doctor.
"There had been a hoax call for an accident and the ambulance that picked me up was on its way back to the station.
"If I had waited for another ambulance, I would have probably died at the scene. I had to have a 68-pint blood transfusion because I had severed the femoral arteries in both my legs."
A cry for help
Stubbs would later have his right leg amputated, and treatment on his damaged left leg. Months after, as he was undergoing rehabilitation, Stubbs was lost and did not know how to cope with his predicament.
"You're thrown into this situation where you've acquired a disability through no fault of your own," he said.
I feel like my life has gone full circle now
John Stubbs
"I felt like I was a burden on my family. I was seeking solace in the bottle.
"It was at that point I felt there was only one way out and that was when I tried to commit suicide."
Fortunately for Stubbs, a concerned neighbour and close friend Mark Chadwick had followed him to a local pond, where he had attempted to drown himself.
"My neighbour dragged me out," said Stubbs.
"It was a cry for help more than anything. My doctor was told about this and I went through counselling."
'I realised I had a lot more to offer'
Stubbs received treatment at a clinic in Withington, Manchester, where he realised his situation was better than other people in less favourable circumstances.
"It felt like a shock treatment to me. Going in there and seeing people that would love to be in the position I was. It was that kind of place where they relied on other things to keep them going," he said.
John Stubbs
Stubbs did not win a medal at the London 2012 Paralympics but returned to the podium four years later in Rio with a silver in the mixed team event
"That's when I realised 'what have I got to complain about?' It was a reality check for me and it really hit me hard, emotionally. I realised I had a lot more to offer."
'Archery made me a success'
With his new-found determination and drive to succeed in life, Stubbs tried a variety of sports before finding his true purpose, armed with a bow and a set of arrows, in 1994.
"I was playing disabled cricket but I felt like I needed an extra activity," he said.

"I went down to a disabled sports club to try a variety of things because I was struggling to find a sport that would float my boat. But then I peered through some double doors and there was this guy teaching archery, who beckoned me to come and have a go.
"I was really chuffed that I had found something that challenged me," added the former world number one Para-archer.
"I didn't feel like I had that when I had my accident. That was what was missing.
"I never realised at the time where it would actually take me and now I've been across the world with it. It made me realise that I've been very fortunate in my life as a disabled person. It made me a success."
Accident anniversary given new meaning
Although Stubbs went on to top the podium at European and world events, with a career-defining moment as a gold medallist at the Beijing 2008 Paralympics, he would always feel low on the anniversary of his accident.
That was until he claimed two gold medals and a silver at the 2013 World Para-archery Championships in Thailand on its 24th anniversary.
John Stubbs at the 2013 World Para-Archery Championships in Thailand
Stubbs won two gold medals and a silver at the World Para-Archery Championships on 6 November 2013 - the 24th anniversary of his accident
"I always used to look at that date in a negative stance because that's the day my whole world changed," he said.
"I did that every year right up until I won gold on that day. To compete and win a gold medal on what usually was a sad day... I used to remember that day for all the wrong reasons but now it will be remembered for a good reason."
The next World Para-archery Championships are in Beijing this September and Stubbs feels there is room for one more gold medal to complete his career.
"I want to win gold at the World Championships in Beijing," he said. "I won a Paralympic gold medal there in 2008 and I feel like my life has gone full circle now." Paralympic silver and bronze medallist Charlotte Henshaw has retired from swimming and taken up canoeing.
The Briton, who won silver at London 2012 and bronze at Rio 2016, holds the SB6 100m breaststroke European record.
But, after being identified by British Canoeing, the 31-year-old is a member of their talent confirmation programme.
"I watched the brilliant Paracanoe performances in Rio and was keen to try something new," said Henshaw, who has had both legs amputated above the knee.
"I felt like I was ready to take on a new challenge that is different from anything I have done before."
Henshaw began canoeing at the end of 2016 and hopes to qualify for the European Championships as she sets her sights on competing at another Paralympics.
"A fourth Paralympic Games would be beyond what I had ever imagined, but I would love to be there in Tokyo - on the water instead of in it this time," she added. Double Paralympic champion Kadeena Cox has been left out of the British Para-cycling performance squad.
The 26-year-old, who won gold medals in both cycling and athletics in Rio last year, is instead focusing on training for the World Para-Athletics Championships in London this summer.
Cox had her UK Sport funding suspended in January while she took part in Channel 4 programme The Jump.
GB's 26-strong squad includes Rio gold medallists Sarah Storey and Jody Cundy.
Storey, 39, became Britain's most successful female Paralympian when she won her 14th gold medal at the Rio Games.
Cundy, 38, and like Storey a former swimmer, has won seven Paralympic golds - four in cycling.
They are joined in the 'podium squad' by fellow Paralympic medallists Megan Giglia, Karen Darke, Jon-Allan Butterworth, Louis Rolfe, Crystal Lane and David Stone.
With no track events scheduled for 2017 or 2018, British Cycling is happy to allow Cox extended time away from the programme.
It said in a statement: "Kadeena decided to take a break from cycling at the start of 2017 to pursue other opportunities afforded to her by her incredible achievements at the Paralympics, a decision we fully respect.
"Her focus is currently on her training programme for the 2017 IPC Athletic World Championships in London and she has the full support of the Great Britain cycling team."
Tuesday's squad announcement comes a fortnight after British Cycling announced changes to the Para-cycling pathway in the build-up to Tokyo 2020.
Riders on the Paralympic world-class programme are now split into two groups - podium and podium potential - while a foundation programme has also been established.
Great Britain 2017 squad in full:
Podium: James Ball, Steve Bate, Jon-Allan Butterworth, Jody Cundy, Karen Darke, Adam Duggleby, Lora Fachie, Neil Fachie, Megan Giglia, Jon Gildea, Corrine Hall, Crystal Lane, Craig Maclean, Pete Mitchell, Louis Rolfe, Matt Rotherham, Helen Scott, David Stone, Dame Sarah Storey, Sophie Thornhill.
Podium Potential: Will Bjergfelt, Craig McCann, Mel Nicholls, Simon Price, Liz Saul, David Smith. Why get into sport?	Being active is a great way to improve your health, clear your mind and put you into a better mood.

21-26: World Para Badminton Championships, Ulsan, South Korea The UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) hearing examining allegations Tyson Fury took a performance-enhancing substance has been postponed.
Press Association Sport reports Ukad took its decision due to a potential conflict of interest on its panel.
The hearing began on Monday and was expected to conclude this week. A future date for when it will resume is yet to be confirmed.
Fury has denied wrongdoing, and previously threatened to sue Ukad.
The 28-year-old is back in training but has not fought since beating Wladimir Klitschko to become heavyweight champion of the world in November 2015.
He had his licence revoked in October as he dealt with mental health problems, but had been aiming to return on the Billy Joe Saunders-Avtandil Khurtsidze undercard on 8 July.
Froch: 'Difficult to argue' with Fury's Joshua claim
BBC Radio 5 live boxing podcast: Fury on Anthony Joshua
Ukad charged both Fury and his fellow heavyweight boxing cousin Hughie, 22, with the "presence of a prohibited substance" on 24 June 2016.
Prior to that, the Sunday Mirror reported that traces of banned substance nandrolone had been found in a urine sample taken from Fury in February 2015.
Frank Warren, who promotes both Tyson and Hughie Fury, described the postponement as "ridiculous".
He added: "We want to see the end of this. It's gone on and on. It's been over their heads for two years. It's taken all this time to get there and in the meantime there's no outcome." Venue: Barclaycard Arena, Birmingham Date: Saturday 13 May
Coverage: Live text commentary on BBC Sport website and app.
Kal Yafai is preparing to make the first defence of his WBA title defence against Suguru Muranaka on Saturday, with plans to unify the super-flyweight division already on his mind.
Yafai meets 31-year-old Japanese Muranaka in Birmingham.
The 27-year-old became the city's first world champion when he beat Panama's Luis Concepcion in December.
"Unification bouts are very much part of my plan, and sooner rather than later," he said.
"Whatever my team puts in front of me, that's what I'll take. I've got the best team in the business around me who advise me what to do and when to do it, so I listen to them first and foremost.
"But I like to take it all one fight at a time. I've got to concentrate on this fight and then we'll go from there and see what is next."
Muranaka's countryman Naoya Inoue holds the WBO belt, Filipino Jerwin Ancajas is the IBF champion, and Thailand's Wisaksil Wangek claimed the WBC title from Roman Gonzalez in March.
"Ancajas could be the likeliest of unifications, but it depends on when they are available," Yafai added.
"I'd love to fight Gonzalez. Obviously he's the name in the division. In the rematch, which seems to be on the cards, I think he'll beat Wangek convincingly.
"If I had to hold out and have another defence or two before fighting Gonzalez, then I'd do that." Tyson Fury's claim he would deal with Anthony Joshua "like a cat playing with wool" is "difficult to argue with", says former world champion Carl Froch.
Fury, 28, is back in training but has not fought since beating Wladimir Klitschko on points in November 2015.
Fellow Briton Joshua, 27, stopped the Ukrainian last month in the 11th round of a fight that went back and forth.
Froch said Fury had "kind of played with Klitschko", while Joshua "struggled" when he fought him.
The three-time super-middleweight champion was a ringside commentator as Fury beat Klitschko in Dusseldorf to become world heavyweight champion.
Speaking on the Friday Sports Panel on BBC Radio 5 live, Froch said: "He had his hands behind his back at times.
"He was tapping his foot and was goading and was nonchalant in his mannerisms from the first bell right through to the last - and this is a guy that Anthony Joshua struggled with."
Listen: I'm 26 stone and I'd box rings round Joshua - Fury
Fury is the subject of a UK Anti-Doping hearing, which relates to a failed test in June of last year, and a potential fight between him and Joshua could depend on the outcome.
Froch, 39, says Fury needs to get himself into fighting shape before he considers taking on the unified world champion.
He said: "He's been out of the ring two years, he's had issues that I don't want to bring up, so is he going to be the same guy who beat Klitschko?
"Of course he isn't. He's probably going to need a couple of fights but he's certainly a really exciting and interesting addition to the heavyweight division."
You can hear more from Froch on Fury and Joshua by downloading the Friday Sports Panel podcast. He also talks about unsuccessfully trying to "bury the hatchet" with former foe George Groves, who he beat in a blockbuster fight at Wembley Stadium in May 2014. Britain's double Olympic champion Nicola Adams wants to impress her home fans when she takes on Mexico's Maryan Salazar in Leeds on Saturday.
The fight, Adams' second as a professional and first in her home city for 20 years, will be over four three-minute rounds, rather than the usual two-minute rounds for women.
"I've looked at videos of my opponent and I know her style and I hope she'll come out confident and trying to win because I want to make sure I put on a great show for my fans," she said.
"Nights like Saturday are what I got into boxing for and what I turned professional for. I want to be fighting in the big-time and hopefully one day I will emulate my idols and fight in Las Vegas."
The flyweight voiced her frustration with two-minute rounds after beating Virginia Carcamo last month.
Adams, 34, says the extra minute in each round will give her a chance to try out things she has learnt in the gym.
She said: "I had two minutes to find my rhythm, distance and take out my opponent. It's not enough time.
"I found, by the end of the rounds, I needed a couple more seconds and it would be over.
"Now we have three minutes, I'm able to relax more, establish the jab, find the rhythm properly and really get in the swing of things."
Salazar, 18, has lost once in six professional contests.
On the same card, WBC international featherweight champion Josh Warrington defends his title against Spain's Kiko Martinez. A glorious night answered so many questions.
Anthony Joshua is the real deal. Wladimir Klitschko is far from done. Heavyweight boxing can prosper through brilliance. There was no need for insults here.
Yet there will be no pause for breath after a breathless Joshua stoppage win. The questions simply evolve.
Tyson Fury took mere moments to stir the pot, Deontay Wilder likewise. Will they get their shot at a man now hailed as "the biggest sports star in Britain" and tipped to become boxing's richest ever fighter?

5 live podcast: Joshua-Klitschko reaction
Who next? 'Fury believes he beats AJ'
In stopping the most dominant heavyweight of this century in front of a record post-war UK boxing crowd - in a fight which had everything - Joshua has everywhere to go and yet nowhere to go.
Matching an event as iconic as this - delivering a pay day to beat the ?15m he was expected to earn and finding an opponent capable of competing - looks a tall order in the short-term. Yet the big names will champion their cause.
"Fury, where you at baby?" Joshua said. The Gypsy King was busy tweeting: "You had life and death with Klitschko, I played with the guy. Let's dance."
Tyson Fury
Former world champion Tyson Fury looks keen to fight Joshua, although he is currently suspended
Joshua did hit the canvas hard before toppling Klitschko. Fury ducked, weaved and earned a comfortable points win by comparison in 2015.
"Tyson Fury will be watching that and thinking I haven't even got to lose six stone to beat AJ," said 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce.
"Could Fury have beaten AJ when he beat Klitschko? The answer is yes."
Substantially overweight and devoid of a boxing licence, former world champion Fury will likely need time and a warm-up bout before meeting the IBF and WBA champion.
WBC champion Deontay Wilder warned Joshua not to get "comfortable", while Klitschko confirmed he holds a rematch option, adding that he believes the champion is "vulnerable" at times.
"I could have done more to finish him off," said the 41-year-old.
Deontay Wilder
WBC world champion Deontay Wilder is also keen to take on Joshua
The options are plentiful on paper but timing is the crucial factor. Fury will surely happen one day but not soon, meeting Klitschko swiftly before age robs him of further edge is a challenge and Wilder's lack of appeal in the UK also presents difficulty.
Bunce added: "Wilder needs at least one more fight - he is not at the pay-per-view stature yet."
'The richest boxer ever'
Wladimir Klitschko and Anthony Joshua
Joshua connected with a huge uppercut in round 11 to end Klitschko's resistance
Joshua's rise, after being all-but beaten in the sixth round, to administer a devastating uppercut and finish in the 11th, wowed the world of boxing. American viewers tuned in and lapped up the destruction.
Legendary boxers Sugar Ray Leonard and Evander Holyfield were just some of those tweeting praise, while promoter Eddie Hearn believes his fighter's profile is now "stratospheric", adding: "He is unquestionably world boxing's biggest star."
Hearn is just a piece in the jigsaw of a team which has made Joshua a juggernaut in world sport. His standing as a marketable asset for more than a dozen global brands brings closer his ambition to become boxing's first billionaire, while it also heaps pressure on his broad shoulders.
"The win accelerates him to be one of the world's most sought-after major properties," said sports marketing expert Alun James, UK chief executive at Four Sports and Sponsorships.

'Not perfect' Joshua plans next steps
"A YouGov survey showed 20% of the UK population have a favourable view of him. That is a very good number for boxing, which is not a mainstream sport.
"Because he's a young black man, he also allows brands to extend into demographics they haven't worked in before. He's already working with brands from Asia to the US, the UK and Dubai.
"I think he will certainly be the richest boxer ever and probably surpass Floyd Mayweather, who set the benchmark."
What we learned - a raw fighting machine
Klitschko is no stranger to being knocked down - he hit the deck three times in beating Samuel Peter on points in 2005 and such resistance subsequently spawned an 11-year unbeaten run until 2015.
The fact Joshua has now tasted being decked and briefly humbled may well be viewed as a positive behind closed doors. No longer will doubters wonder about his heart. The world now knows what will is hidden beneath those pectorals.
Wladimir Klitschko and Anthony Joshua
Joshua was knocked down for the first time in his career in the sixth round
"There comes a time where it comes from within," said BBC Radio 5 live pundit Richie Woodhall. "It is DNA or whatever you want to call it. Those punches came from the depths of his soul. That is what being a world champion is all about."
This great British hope showed transitions, boxing admirably early on, taking punishment in the middle rounds, and then switching things up to power punching, seizing his moment with killer instinct.
"There were times where he showed his inexperience but he learned and showed he isn't just a prospect," said Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken. "He can turn around fights and that will help him so much in his career."
Just 19 fights and now 55 rounds into his career, Joshua has every right to remain green in parts. Smiles at his opponent and celebrations after knockdowns will perhaps be stamped out. Indeed Klitschko said afterwards he felt his rival "lost focus" at times.
In truth, the grand surroundings of Wembley are fit for a fully developed fighter. Joshua beat one, though both he and his team will admit he is not himself one yet, even if he did answer questions.
"He was raw at times which he is, and at times he was probably exposed but to get exposed in front of 90,000 people, to bite down on your gum shield, and to knock out Klitschko in the 11th round, you can't buy that heart," added Hearn.
A show of temperament
The chin has been tested, as has Joshua's heart, but what about the mind?
Celebrities fell over themselves to engage with him within minutes of his win, A-list names on Twitter jumping on the expanding AJ bandwagon.
Joshua v Klitschko
Joshua has won all 19 of his professional victories inside the distance
He handled an expectant 90,000 crowd and surely no fight to come can be bigger from a stadium perspective?
Yet heavyweight boxing can provide a slap of reality. Mike Tyson ran into Buster Douglas, Lennox Lewis fell to Hasim Rahman.
But the focus and creative nature of his training drills - visible in their droves on Instagram - seem to showcase a desire to keep striving and try different things in pursuit of excellence.
Away from the ring, Joshua talks about different cultures in a studious way. He has a mind which seems unlikely to fall lazy and such drive will be critical.
There were moments where he visibly took deep breaths when under fire from Klitschko, and expect him to find solutions in the gym. As hype and distractions mount, it is reassuring to know he finds comfort there.
The champion said: "I showed that fights are won in the gym. It gets tough and boxing isn't easy. You have to have the whole package."
With every passing punch, he looks just that. They face off in boxing's glamour division, but only a few are ever good enough to make their mark.
Great Britain waited nearly 96 years between Bob Fitzsimmons' world heavyweight title win and Lennox Lewis claiming a version of the title in 1992.

Bob Fitzsimmons - 61 wins, 8 losses, 4 draws
Active: 1885-1914
Bob Fitzsimmons
Photography was in its infancy when Fitzsimmons reigned as world heavyweight champion
Born in Cornwall but largely raised in New Zealand, Fitzsimmons was the first fighter to win titles in three divisions - becoming world champion at middleweight, light-heavyweight and heavyweight.
A blacksmith by trade, he became known as a brutal puncher. In winning the middleweight title in 1891, he reportedly knocked down opponent Jack Dempsey (not the later heavyweight champion of the same name) 13 times.
Henry Cooper - 40 wins, 14 losses, 1 draw
Active: 1954-1971
Muhammad Ali and Henry Cooper
Cooper troubled Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) in the fourth round but was beaten in the fifth of their title fight at Wembley
Cooper's trademark left hook - christened 'Enry's 'Ammer' - famously dropped Muhammad Ali (then known as Cassius Clay) at Wembley Stadium in 1963. The London fighter did not have enough time to close the job in the fourth round and Ali's canny trainer, Angelo Dundee, delayed the start of the fifth, claiming his man's gloves were damaged. A British, Commonwealth and European champion, Cooper was the first person to win BBC Sports Personality of the Year twice.
Joe Bugner - 69 wins, 13 losses, 1 draw
Active: 1967-1999
Bugner met Ali in 1973 and 1975 losing by unanimous decision on both occasions
Bugner fought Muhammad Ali in 1973 and 1975, losing by unanimous decision on both occasions
Hungary-born but a naturalised resident of the UK and, later, Australia, Bugner fought for more than 31 years. He lost to Muhammad Ali on points twice, and also took Joe Frazier to the cards. A world title eluded him, although he held European and British belts.
Frank Bruno - 40 wins, 5 losses
Active: 1982-1996
Bruno twice lost to Tyson, here in 1989 and later in the last fight of his career in 1996
Bruno twice lost to Tyson, here in 1989 and later in the final fight of his career in 1996
He lost world title bouts to Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis before capturing the WBC belt in the penultimate fight of his career - out-pointing Oliver McCall at Wembley in 1995. Much loved by the British public, Bruno was a destructive force, landing 38 wins by knockout.
Lennox Lewis - 41 wins, 2 losses, 1 draw
Active: 1989-2003
Lennox Lewis knocking out former champion Mike Tyson in his penultimate fight in 2002
Lennox Lewis knocked out former champion Mike Tyson in his penultimate fight in 2002
The last man to be undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, courtesy of his 1999 victory over Evander Holyfield. His list of conquests includes the likes of Mike Tyson and Vitali Klitschko, brother of Wladimir. Lewis avenged his two defeats by securing knockout wins over Oliver McCall and Hasim Rahman.
David Haye - 28 wins, 3 losses
Active: 2002-present
Nikolai Valuev and David Haye
Haye's speed and agility saw him win the world title against a lumbering Nikolai Valuev in Nuremberg
A unified champion at cruiserweight, Haye became the first man since Evander Holyfield to also win a world title at heavyweight. He took the WBA belt from Nikolai Valuev in 2009 in a fight in which he weighed in almost seven stones lighter than his opponent. He is now three fights into a return to the sport, losing his most recent bout to Tony Bellew.
Tyson Fury - 25 wins (unbeaten)
Active: 2008-present
Wladimir Klitschko and Tyson Fury
Fury's victory over Klitschko was regarded as one of the greatest upsets in heavyweight history
Fury produced an excellent performance to end Wladimir Klitschko's 11-year unbeaten run and claim the WBA, IBF and WBO titles in November 2015. Fury has since battled personal problems and does not have an active licence to compete at the moment, although has vowed to return. His ascent to world level took in British, Commonwealth and European titles.
Anthony Joshua - 19 wins (unbeaten)
Active: 2013-present
Anthony Joshua with his world title belts
Joshua holds two of the four world heavyweight title belts and wants to unify the division
Like Lewis, Olympic gold preceded his professional career but it took Joshua just 34 rounds to land the IBF world title. His rapid rise through the professional ranks made him just the second fighter - after Frazier - to hold a world heavyweight title while still reigning as Olympic champion.

Two years later, when the American won middleweight gold at London 2012, she proved it.
At Rio 2016, she became the first American boxer to successfully defend an Olympic title and achieved another milestone this month when she was the first woman to headline a boxing show on a premium network in the United States.
As part of the BBC's State of Sport week, she told Ade Adedoyin that boxing saved her life.

My childhood
Claressa Shields
In Flint, 41% of the population live below the poverty line, according to the 2015 American Community Survey
I was born in Flint, Michigan in 1995, but I didn't start talking until I was five.
By then, my father had been in prison for three years for dealing drugs. I wouldn't meet him again for another four.
I'm not going to say my mum didn't care for us, but she left us to fend for ourselves. She abused alcohol and didn't know how to control it.
There were times my little sister and I would walk around looking for mum for days on end.
I'd have to go out and get food and whatever food we got I would always give to my younger siblings. If there were two packs of ramen noodles, my little sister ate one, my little brother ate one and I didn't eat.
We would sleep on the couch or the floor - and more than likely my sister or my brother was on the couch, so I would be on the floor.

Women's boxing: History-maker Claressa Shields tops the bill
Growing up and going without instilled an independence in me. I learned if anyone's going to take care of you, it's going to be you. You don't get upset about things, you just get used to it.
But you learn ways around it. You learn how to do little jobs for money - walking to the store for people and grabbing their groceries will get you about two dollars.
It was at this time, though, that I was raped. It happened every day for about six months by a person known to the family.
My aunt had never seen me cry. I was always a good, quiet child - but she saw fear in my eyes.
I couldn't speak well as a child - I had a speech impediment - so when she asked me what had happened, I wasn't able to say it. She gave me a doll and I was able to show her everything he had done to me.
I was kind of terrified of men for a while and my anger was really bad.
I was really quiet, smart and very skinny, but I got bullied when I was seven or eight. People would copy my work and make fun of me all the time because of my stutter.
One day I was at my desk and a girl walked past, said something and pulled my hair. I didn't do anything, just put my head down - but then this girl walked past and pulled my hair again. So I got up and I punched her. The feeling was one of relief.
I was kicked out for a couple of days, but when I came back to school nobody messed with me. So from that day, anybody who messed with me, I fought them.

The only defeat on Shields' record came against England's Savannah Marshall (right) at the 2012 World Championships
Proving my dad wrong
My dad had been out of prison a couple of years by then and getting to know him definitely helped me understand things about myself.
I didn't know why I was easily angered before, but his temper is way worse than mine. In the same way, I didn't know why I laughed so loud, but he laughed just as hard as me.
One day we were in the city and he was very stressed out. He had been in prison for so many years and was trying to change his life, but wasn't getting any jobs or opportunities.
"If I stuck to what I was passionate about, I wouldn't be in this situation," he said.
"What were you passionate about?" I asked.
"Boxing," he replied. "They used to call me cannonball because my fist was hard and I was fast as lightning."
He said he thought some of my cousins would take up the sport, but none did.
He mentioned that of Muhammad Ali's nine children only his daughter Leila Ali took up boxing - and when he said that I thought he was asking me to take after him, so I headed to the gym at Berston Field House in Flint.
After about three days down there my coach Jason said my parents had to sign me up.
My dad said: "No! Boxing is a man's sport and you're too pretty to box."
"What the hell are you talking about?" I said. "I'm not going to be a model. I'm not going to be a singer. I'm going to be some type of athlete - and I want to be a boxer."
A few days later, I went to his house and it was like an intervention. Him, his wife and her three kids were sitting at this table in the dining room and they all voted on if I should box or not.
Everybody else said yeah, he said no. That was my first victory. I beat my dad, majority decision.
He said that once he signed me up and paid my $60 membership, I couldn't quit boxing for a year.
My dad will tell you today that was the best $60 he ever spent.

Teenager Shields wins boxing gold for US
Six years later, I was going to London 2012.
I was a 25-1 shot and they are not good odds. I heard some commentators say that, at 17, I would be lucky to get a bronze medal.
I watched the Russian Nadezda Torlopova win her semi-final and thought there is no way she can beat me. They always say the Russians are strong, though, and I felt like the female Rocky.
When the announcer said "the winner, from the United States" I just remember being calm.
I felt vindicated. I had told people and I had shown people.
I held in how much I wanted to celebrate 2012 for four years. I didn't go to the club or celebrate with friends. I was back in the gym three months later.
Before Rio 2016, I kept hearing that no American boxer had ever defended an Olympic title.
Not Joe Frazier, not George Foreman not Pernell Whitaker, not Oscar de la Hoya, not Leon Spinks - but I would say: "Well, I ain't them."
Reporters would comment on how confident I was, but if you believe in yourself and work hard, how can you not be confident?
I worked harder than anyone around me, and I worked alone a lot. I didn't care about accolades or people saying you're working really hard. I did it for myself.
I knew I had checked my boxes. All of them. I knew I had it in the bag, it was just about going out there and doing it, those last little 10 steps.
I made the final fight look so easy. I was so calm and so dominant all fight.
When they announced the result, I grabbed the flag and just ran around screaming. My mind kind of left my body.
After all the things I had been through in my life, I just looked out on where I was. I was able to make it. It didn't stop me.

Shields did not drop a round in her Rio 2016 campaign
A reminder of the past
The last time I saw the man who raped me was when I was 16.
He was walking his dog. He looked at me and I looked at him.
Thank God he did have the dog. If he didn't I would have beaten him up and would have probably been in jail before I got a chance to go to the Olympics.
But you can't let something someone did to you - something that made you feel so worthless - stop your life.
I'm not going to let a man that evil and foul have control over me. I'm not going to let him be the decision-maker.
I could have made bad choices in life, but I was still in school, still boxing and still winning.
It didn't stop me from being great. The quest for perfection
Presented by
David Haye
Former world champion
Expert analysis from
Rob McCracken
Boxing coach
The night air crackled with tension. In the ring, the two protagonists were engaged in boxing?s equivalent of a chess match ? cagey, tactical, back and forth. Then everything changed. The champion detonated a huge right hand, perfectly timed, onto the chin of the challenger, and the fight was over. Carl Froch had defeated George Groves in their rematch in May 2014 and the 80,000 Wembley crowd exploded at the raw, brutal closure of the contest.
There are few sights in sport as shocking and unforgettable as witnessing a one-punch knockout. Boxers have a wide variety of favourite types of punches, and there are many different kinds of knockouts. But what components combine to produce perfection? Is power as important as technique, and does timing beat speed?
Former WBA heavyweight champion David Haye is ideally qualified to answer these questions, as he explains: "I have plenty of personal experience of knockouts, as 26 of my 28 career victories to date have come by way of KO. So what does it take to land the perfect punch?" Speed kills

From Carl Froch to Ricky Hatton, relive some memorable knockouts as 'The Hayemaker' gives priceless tips on improving your punching power (David Haye footage courtesy of Dave, all other fight footage courtesy of Sky Sports).
David Haye explains what makes the perfect punch:
A misconception exists that a huge muscular guy can punch harder than a skinny guy. In my experience, people who can move from one point to another quickly cannot only punch hard, but knock out their opponents. Throughout my career I have focused on being able to punch very fast and hit people where they can?t see the punch. If you hit someone where they?re not aware there is going to be a punch landing, they can?t brace for it, so the impact is much greater.
It is hard to counter someone without speed, unless you are very lucky and just wing a punch that your opponent doesn?t see. Timing is vital. Speed and timing are both key, but if your timing is out, you can?t land your punch. Good balance is a crucial element of throwing a knockout punch. You need to be able to explode from your feet, using every ounce of your weight. It is not about how strong your arms are - the key is to have a strong core, in terms of your glutes, hamstrings and quads.
You need to generate power to explode through your target. It is not about how hard you can hit that person, it is the velocity of the movement coming through the target that causes maximum impact. People who have high knockout ratios do not look to punch at their opponent's chin, they look to punch 12 inches through the chin, and that motion is what leads to the knockout.

What it feels like to be knocked out
Mike Tyson knocks out British boxer Julius Francis
Mike Tyson knocks out Julius Francis.
Former British and Commonwealth Heavyweight Champion Julius Francis describes what it was like facing Mike Tyson when they fought in Manchester on 29 January 2000:
Coming across the ring towards me, Tyson had this unbelievable intensity and ferocity about him. My plan went straight out the window. If someone hits me, I want to hit him back, that's the sort of person I am. But it's different against Tyson. He hit me immediately with a big right and I was shocked by the speed and power of the punches that followed.
I was knocked down in the first round. I got up, he carried on and the rest of the fight was a bit of a blur. He was hitting me with all sorts of body and head shots; he even lifted me off the ground with some of them and I weighed 17 stone! It was relentless. The angles he got into me from were incredible. People always talk about his punching power, but his technique and timing are also excellent. He always gets inside you and can outbox and out-jab you. He was such a gifted fighter.
When I was interviewed afterwards, they told me I had been knocked down five times and I was amazed. I didn't believe them until I watched it on a monitor. I wasn't really thinking about it at the time and just kept on getting back up. The pain didn't kick in properly until I was back in the hotel, after the press conference; then I was in all sorts of agony. I lay in the bath for hours recovering. I won't forget the pain in a hurry.

Bellew v Haye: Their rivalry in their own words
Take the test: Which sport suits your personality? Adrian Lewis hit the first nine-dart finish of the 2017 Premier League in his 7-4 win over Raymond van Barneveld in Liverpool.
The Stoke-on-Trent thrower landed two 180s before taking out a 141 checkout with double 12.
"It's really special and a great feeling," said Lewis, 32, after his fifth televised perfect leg.
Gary Anderson took three points from his two matches to move up to third in the table.
The Scot, who won the Premier League in 2011 and 2015, snatched a 6-6 draw against Dave Chisnall before putting in a superb display to beat Peter Wright 7-2.
Wright failed to take advantage of his double gameweek, drawing 6-6 with league leader Michael van Gerwen having led the world champion 5-1 in his first outing on Thursday.
Van Gerwen is two points clear of Wright at the top of the table and also has a game in hand on the UK Open winner.
James Wade kept his hopes of a top-four spot alive with a 7-5 victory over 16-times world champion Phil Taylor, who dropped out of the play-off places with his defeat.

Taylor's 7-3 win over the PDC world champion kept him fourth in the table, two points clear of Dave Chisnall.
The 56-year-old will qualify for the play-offs if he avoids defeat by Adrian Lewis in Aberdeen.
However, a narrow loss on 11 May should also be enough for the 16-time world champion to go through as he has a vastly superior leg difference to his fellow Englishman.
Van Gerwen, who is hoping to finish top of the Premier League table for the fifth year in succession, remained a point clear of second-placed Wright despite his loss to Taylor.
Wade had already been eliminated with his loss to third-placed Anderson, while Taylor's victory ended the play-off hopes of Lewis and Raymond van Barneveld, who lost to Wright and Chisnall respectively in their penultimate group matches.

Five-time world champion Van Barneveld, who celebrated his 50th birthday on Thursday, looked out of sorts and drops to fifth in a tight table.
Second-placed Peter Wright kept the pressure on pacesetter Van Gerwen with a comfortable victory over James Wade, who slipped to the bottom of the table.
Before his loss to Chisnall, 16-time world champion Taylor won seven straight legs to beat Scot Gary Anderson 7-4 to remain in the hunt for a play-off spot in his final season before retirement.
Premier League - round 12 Michael van Gerwen and Peter Wright became the first two players to secure Premier League play-off spots with wins in Birmingham.
League leader Van Gerwen took three points from his two games, drawing with Dave Chisnall before whitewashing Adrian Lewis 7-0.
Wright beat Phil Taylor 7-3 to stay second in the table.
Gary Anderson and Taylor are third and fourth, but Lewis' qualification chances were damaged by two defeats.
Having lost 7-4 to James Wade in Thursday's opening match, Stoke-on-Trent thrower Lewis had no answer to an imperious performance by defending Premier League champion Van Gerwen.
Anderson's 7-4 victory over Raymond van Barneveld left the veteran Dutchman one point outside the top four.
However, with each player having only two matches left in the group stage, only four points separate third-placed Anderson and Wade, who stayed bottom of the table despite his victory. John McGuinness broke four vertebrae and three ribs in addition to the leg fracture that he sustained in his crash at the North West 200 on Thursday.
Initial reports indicated McGuinness, 45, had sustained a broken leg.
The English rider's Honda team said on Friday that McGuinness would remain in Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital for another week.
"John will wear a cast for up to six weeks in treatment for the vertebrae," said the Honda statement.
McGuinness ruled out of Isle of Man TT
McGuinness' injuries mean he will miss the Isle of Man TT which starts in two weeks.
"John has been diagnosed with a compound fracture to his right lower leg, while in theatre on Thursday night it was not possible to plate the leg as initially thought due to the extent of the injury, and tomorrow an external fixator will be fitted," added the Honda statement.
"In addition, John has also suffered four broken vertebrae and has three broken back ribs."
The Englishman has earned 23 career wins at the Isle of Man event which begins with a week of qualifying on 27 May before competition starts on 3 June.
His wins tally puts him second in the all-time TT list behind the legendary late Joey Dunlop, who won 26 times at the Isle of Man meeting.

Martin also out of Superbike and Superstock classes
Following McGuinness' crash, Honda Racing have opted to withdraw their bikes from the Superstock and Superbike events in Saturday's North West 200 races.
English star Guy Martin was scheduled to also compete for the team in both races although he will still race for the Wilson Craig outfit in the Supersport class.
Honda team manager Jonny Twelvetrees said that McGuinness had sustained "a substantial injury to his right tibia and fibula".
"It is a real blow to John and the team, but he's got an incredible amount of spirit and is in very good hands with the medical staff at the Royal Victoria Hospital," added the Honda team boss.
McGuinness has also earned six North West 200 wins during his 27-year career.
Thursday's accident happened at the Primrose Hill section of the course around 20 minutes before the practice session was scheduled to end.
McGuinness dislocated a thumb during a Honda team test at Castle Combe in early April.
Action resumed on Thursday evening at the Northern Ireland road racing meeting when Supersport, Superstock and Supertwins races took place.
There will be five further races on Saturday's main race day at the event. Dani Pedrosa led from pole to win the Spanish Grand Prix, as world championship leader Valentino Rossi finished 10th at Circuito de Jerez.
Pedrosa, 31, was more than six seconds ahead of MotoGP champion Marc Marquez to head a Repsol Honda one-two.
Ducati's Jorge Lorenzo was third to complete an all-Spanish podium despite starting from eighth.
Pramac's Scott Redding was the highest placed Briton, finishing 11th, as Cal Crutchlow crashed out after 22 laps.
It was MotoGP's 3,000th race and Pedrosa's first win on Spanish soil since he won at Jerez in 2013. It was also his first victory in MotoGP since San Marino last September.
Italian veteran Rossi, was more than 38 seconds behind Pedrosa. But the 38-year-old, who is chasing an eighth world title, keeps his place atop the standings with 62 points.
He is two points ahead of Yamaha team-mate Maverick Vinales in second with Marquez third on 52 points and Pedrosa fourth on 50.

Danny Phillips was captaining for King's Lynn Young Stars at Mildenhall when he crashed coming off a bend, going underneath the air fence and colliding with the back barrier.
The 20-year-old was taken away by air ambulance as King's Lynn lost the meeting 63-27.
Mildenhall said they took an impromptu collection for the Air Ambulance after the crash, which raised ?645.

Guy Martin will be reunited with former sponsor Wilson Craig to ride a 600cc Honda in the Supersport races at next week's North West 200.
The Lincolnshire rider rode the machine at last week's Cookstown 100.
"Guy was happy with the bike at Cookstown and it is now fully prepared for him for next week," said Craig.
"It will be great to see him out in my colours once again and I want to thank Mervyn Whyte for giving us the opportunity to race," he added.
Martin last rode for the County Londonderry businessman in 2010.
The 35-year-old has competed at the Tandragee, Scarborough road races and Cookstown events in recent weeks, but the North West will see him make his first appearance at an international event on his return to the sport after an absence of almost two years.
The television personality came off heavily at the 2015 Ulster Grand Prix and opted out of road racing last year to take part in the Tour Divide cycle race in the USA.
He will also race Superbike and Superstock versions of the new 2017 Fireblade with the Honda Racing squad.
Rutter replaces Kennaugh on Farquhar Supertwin
Meanwhile Michael Rutter will replace Hudson Kennaugh on Ryan Farquhar's IEG/KMR Kawasaki in the Supertwins races at next week's event.
Kennaugh had been set to ride the ER6 Kawasaki in the two Twins races at Portrush alongside outings on Farquhar's Superstock and Superbike.
The South African withdrew his North West entry this week and veteran Rutter has been recruited to ride alongside Lee Johnston on another NI Air Ambulance liveried KMR Kawasaki for the Dungannon-based team.
"Hudson rang me and said he wasn't racing at the North West," Farquhar explained.
"So we have sorted a deal for Michael Rutter to ride the bike. Michael was on the podium on one of my bikes at the 2012 North West and he rode for me at last year's TT as well."

Alastair Seeley extended his all-time record of North West 200 wins to 18 as he clinched a Superstock triumph on the first night of racing at the meeting.
Carrickfergus man Seeley, 37, set a lap record of four minutes, 22.7 seconds as he extended his North West winning run meeting to 10 straight years.
Somerset's Martin Jessopp, 31, earned his first North West victories as he won the Supersport and Supertwin races.
Jessopp and Michael Rutter swapped lap records in a thrilling Supertwin race.

Seeley regroups from Supersport exit
Seeley recovered from a second-lap exit in the opening Supersport race to dominate the Superstock class as his Tyco BMW finished 12.623 seconds ahead of Lee Johnston.
Fermanagh man Johnston, a three-time North West winner, pipped Dean Harrison for second but the Englishman had the consolation of earning his first podium finish at the meeting.
Michael Rutter led early on before retiring but Seeley had a 1.94-second advantage by the halfway point after producing his lap record on the third circuit and he extended his advantage during the remainder of the race.
"I don't know what I'm doing right," said Seeley.
"I've talked about having plenty of lady luck down through the years and it seems to be continuing. Hopefully there will be more of the same on Saturday." Beaten finalist John Higgins insists he has not squandered his last chance to win a fifth World Championship.
The Scot, who turns 42 this month, lost a gripping showpiece 18-15 to world number one Mark Selby on Monday.
But almost two decades since his first world title in 1998, Higgins is adamant he will have m ore opportunities to taste victory at the Crucible Theatre.
"I still think I can come back here and do well; I wouldn't write myself off yet," he said.
"I think I acquitted myself well in this tournament," added Higgins. "I really enjoyed it, the way I played, the way I was thinking, the way I kept myself under control - even at the end there, I felt under control - but a couple of little positional shots went awry and he just punished me.
"I'm delighted to have got to the final, it's just a pity I couldn't go one better, but I'm proud of myself."
How Selby roared back to beat Higgins
Higgins had led the final 10-4, but lost nine of the following 10 frames to trail 13-11 - a deficit he would never overturn.
"I missed the chance, I missed the boat in frame 12, the pink into the middle bag to go 9-3 in front," he asserted. "That was the big, big ball and I missed it.
"From then on, although I got to 10-4, I missed a couple and Mark did great to get to 10-7. He was really strong in the final session and plays such a tough game. You're off the table for so long, and when you get back on, you're out of your rhythm and he just keeps on punishing you.
"Every credit to him, he's a fantastic champion."
'He'll be the challenger to Hendry's seven titles'
John Higgins and Mark Selby shake hands
Higgins was beaten by world number one Selby 18-15
Selby is eight years Higgins' junior, and clinched the championship for the third time in four years.
Higgins expects the Englishman to dominate world snooker "for the foreseeable future", and believes he is the foremost threat to Stephen Hendry's record haul of seven world titles.
"Without a shadow of a doubt, I think he'll add to [his three titles]," Higgins added. "Whether it's one, two, three, or four, he looks as if he'll be the challenger to Hendry's seven.
"I really believe that, because he really is granite, and he's really tough to play against.
"When you look at the likes of Ronnie O'Sullivan, hitting his 40s, myself in my 40s, we're still good players but maybe age is catching up a bit.
"It's maybe up to the likes of Neil Robertson, Judd Trump and Ding Junhui to really challenge him. They'll be watching him go onto three, and some of them have not won one. That'll probably make them desperate to get back on the practice table and try to challenge him." World number one Mark Selby says he cannot believe he has joined snooker's greats by claiming back-to-back World Championship titles at the Crucible.
Selby, 33, became only the fourth player after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan to retain their crown in the modern era.
"I'm speechless to be in that group, wow," he told BBC Sport after fighting back to beat John Higgins 18-15.
"I still cannot believe I have won it for a third time."
Selby's triumph was his fifth ranking title victory of the season and extended his stay at the top of the world rankings to a 116th consecutive week.
The resolve comes from within. You either have it in you or you don't
Mark Selby
"I was over the moon to be coming here as defending champion. I just wanted to put up a good fight," he added.
"I feel I have another world title in me. At my age, I have a good five to seven years still to play at the top and it comes down to the hunger, which I still have."
Asked how it felt to be at the top of the rankings, Selby replied: "It is great. You look at those still playing the game like Higgins and O'Sullivan, Judd Trump and Ding Junhui, and to be above all of them is an amazing feeling."
He was below his best on Sunday and another world title looked in jeopardy at 10-4 down, but a run of nine out of 10 frames turned the match around on Monday.
The comeback specialist was 10-5 down against O'Sullivan in 2014, before eventually triumphing 18-14.
"In the semi-final against Ding and the final I had to dig deep to get through," he said.
"The resolve comes from within. You either have it in you or you don't. Some people let their head go down and give in when someone gets on top of them but I know I won't play well every match."

'The toughest player I ever played'
Higgins, 41, made a 141 break in the final but wilted under pressure from his opponent and was unable to add to his four crowns.
He said: "Without a shadow of a doubt, Mark will add to his tally. He could be the challenger to Stephen Hendry's seven, I really believe that. He is just granite. He is really tough to play against.
"Mark is right up there. I never played Davis in his peak but he was meant to be difficult to play against, Hendry was a different kind of player, as was Ronnie but Mark is the toughest player I have ever played.
"He will dominate for the foreseeable future. Ronnie and myself are in the 40s, we are still good players but age is catching up.
"Neil Robertson, Trump and Ding need to challenge him and watching that tonight will make them desperate to get back on the practice table."
'The ultimate machine'
Selby lags four behind all-time leader Hendry in world title victories and laughed off suggestions he could reach that number.
But six-time winner Davis feels Selby is the "dominant character" while 1991 champion John Parrott says he is "the whole package".
Davis said on BBC TV: "When we look at the quality of players that are potential winners, to think there is a dominant character forcing his way through is amazing.
"Selby is an exceptional player and exceptional match player. It is going to take some young player coming through who takes every part of his game and becomes stronger to knock him off his perch."
Parrott added: "Every facet of his game is there, his safety play is excellent, he knows when to scrap, if he wants to fight or break the balls open he can do that and his temperament is outstanding. That is his trump card above anything else.
"He is the ultimate machine when it comes to match play. The nature of this tournament - the long matches - suits his game, he gets better and stronger as it goes on."
Selby also matches the record of five ranking titles in a season, previously achieved by Hendry in 1990/91 and Ding Junhui in 2013/14, and now has 12 in total.

3: Mark Selby, John Spencer	10: Jimmy White Mark Selby's "amazing achievement" of winning back-to-back world titles should be rewarded with a mural of him in Leicester, says the city's mayor.
Selby, 33, made a stunning comeback on Monday to beat Scotland's John Higgins 18-15 and win his third Crucible crown.
"I am determined that Mark's achievements should be celebrated," mayor Peter Soulsby told BBC Sport.
Last year, Leicester's footballers had their Premier League title win marked by several murals around the city.
Artist Richard Wilson depicted Leicester players and manager Claudio Ranieri in a giant mural to commemorate the Foxes' Premier League title success
Players such as Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, as well as manager Claudio Ranieri, had their portraits painted on the side of buildings in the streets.
In 2016 Selby, a boyhood Leicester City supporter, potted the winning ball in the final against China's Ding Junhui to secure his second world title just 12 minutes after the Foxes became top-flight champions for the first time.
Two years prior to that, Selby won his first world title against Ronnie O'Sullivan, which came in the same year as the football club achieved promotion back to the Premier League.
Soulsby added: "I am sure Mark will understand, being a City fan himself, that last year there was a danger of his win being overshadowed by Leicester City's Premier League victory, but not so this time.
"I think we should have a mural for him, similar to the murals we have in the centre of Leicester celebrating the football club's win.
"This is a fantastic win for Mark, and for Leicester. It is an amazing achievement."
Selby had fallen 10-4 behind in this year's final, before a run of nine out of 10 frames helped him towards victory.

Find out more Mark Selby defended his World Championship title with a stunning comeback to beat John Higgins 18-15 and secure his third crown in four years.
Selby, 33, had trailed 10-4 but claimed nine out of 10 frames to lead 13-11.
Higgins had a mini revival helped by a contentious refereeing decision, but Selby kept his composure to win.
The world number one is only the fourth player after Steve Davis, Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O'Sullivan to claim back-to-back titles in the modern era.
The Englishman picks up a record ?375,000 in prize money, retains the top ranking spot for the 116th consecutive week and gains revenge for the defeat by Higgins in the 2007 final.
No player had come back to win from a greater deficit than six frames in a World Championship final since Dennis Taylor trailed Steve Davis by 8-0 and 9-1 in their 1985 classic.
"I can't believe it, I am still pinching myself now," said Selby. "From 10-4 to get to 10-7 yesterday, I was over the moon as I had nothing left. He outplayed me yesterday. Today I came back fresh and was a lot better.
"When I was 10-4 down I was missing everything and had nothing left. I said 'pull something together'. If you lose, you want to at least go down fighting.
"To have three world titles is unbelievable and to be one of only four players to defend it is something I could only dream of."

Did he hit it? Black ball mystery frustrates Selby
Selby was 47-0 up in the 31st frame, and leading 16-14 on frames, when he potted a red before attempting to roll up to the black ball. It was unclear whether the balls touched and referee Jan Verhaas called a foul.
Selby questioned the decision and score marker Brendan Moore checked the incident on a TV.
The decision was reversed but Moore looked at it from another angle and said he was not sure.
Verhaas then said, "If you are not sure, I will stick to the original decision" and the foul stood.
Higgins took the frame and went just one behind at 16-15, but Selby took the last two he required.

Selby 'blanked out' black ball controversy
Leicester player Selby was out of sorts during Sunday's play at the Crucible, missing straightforward opportunities in the reds to hand his opponent the initiative.
But the 33-year-old, who was named 'The Torturer' by Ronnie O'Sullivan for his gritty victory in 2014 from 10-5 behind, showed similar uncompromising characteristics with a ruthless display.
The third session was the turning point, a slow, turgid affair when he won six out of the seven frames to hold the advantage by two frames.
In the final session, the pre-match favourite made breaks of 71, 70 and a 131 clearance following the contentious call in the 31st frame.
Selby also matches the record of five ranking titles in a season, previously achieved by Hendry in 1990/91 and Ding Junhui in 2013/14, and now has 12 in total.

Higgins' hopes dashed
A dreadful collapse for Higgins means he missed out on moving into second place on his own in the list of most ranking titles won and remains one behind O'Sullivan's five world victories.
Having come through a comfortable semi-final against Barry Hawkins, he was initially at ease against Selby, stroking in a 141 break which equalled O'Sullivan's effort in 2012 as the best break recorded in a World Championship final.
I'm proud of myself but he was too good on the day
John Higgins
But the 41-year-old lost his way on the final day, and late breaks of 88 and 111 were not enough, as he was left frustrated by his rival's dogged performance.
The four-time champion has now lost two finals, but his run moves him up to second in the world rankings behind his opponent.
"Mark is granite, just granite," said Higgins. "In the second session I had my chances, I missed a pink into the middle and I could have gone 9-3 ahead.
"That was a big, big frame. Mark cleared up under extreme pressure. He is a fantastic champion.
"It has been an unbelievable tournament, I gave everything. I came up short to a great champion. I'm proud of myself but he was too good on the day."

World Snooker: Shot of the Championship
Sign up to My Sport to follow snooker news and reports on the BBC app. Double snooker World Championship finalist Matthew Stevens has had his cue stolen from his car.
Stevens, 39, has had the cue since becoming a professional in 1994 and it has helped him win the 2000 Masters and 2003 UK titles.
It was taken from his white BMW between 20:00 BST on Sunday and 08:30 on Monday while it was parked on Gilbert Crescent in Llanelli, Carmarthenshire.
Stevens has promised a reward for the safe return of his cue.
It was in a black case with the word MAXIMUS written in gold on the case.
Dyfed-Powys Police is investigating the theft.
Stevens, from Carmarthen, has twice been a World Championship finalist, losing to Mark Williams in 2000 and Shaun Murphy in 2005. Cliffs Of Moher justified his favourite status with victory on his return to action in the Dee Stakes at Chester.
Ryan Moore positioned the Galileo colt, priced at 4-5, just behind the pace-setting Max Zorin before moving through in the final furlong.
Cliffs Of Moher, in his first race for 195 days, finished a length and half ahead of Bay Of Poets, with Max Zorin third and Mirage Dancer fourth.
The victory was trainer Aidan O'Brien's sixth in the Dee Stakes.
It continued a fantastic run for O'Brien, as his horses filled the first three places in the Chester Vase on Thursday after saddling Winter to victory in Sunday's 1,000 Guineas and Churchill in Saturday's 2,000 Guineas.
Cliffs Of Moher was immediately cut to a best-priced 7-1 for the Epsom Derby on 3 June. Programme producers love a 'round-figure' anniversary.
And at Aintree in 2017 we have plenty to play with: it's half a century - to the day as it happens - since Foinavon's shock success at 100-1; and 40 years have elapsed since Red Rum, the all-time greatest Grand National horse, raised the roof with his historic third win.
Gilded as their places in the race's long and colourful heritage undoubtedly are, the events of 20 years ago - 5-9 April 1997 - will have their own unforgettable place. A colt that nobody wanted could be the one to prove Frankel really is 'the Daddy' as the champion racehorse-turned-stallion gets his hotly anticipated first chance to father a Classic winner.
The oldest of Frankel's offspring are now aged three - part of the 'Classic generation' - and four of them are due to contest the first two of British flat racing's historic features, the 2,000 and 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket.
Colts Eminent and Dream Castle have the 2,000 Guineas in their sights, while it's the 1,000 Guineas, open to fillies only, for Fair Eva and Queen Kindly. Lord Gyllene's trainer will never forget the day they won the Grand National 20 years ago - even if everyone else virtually always does.
1997 was the year when, in only his second year as a trainer under National Hunt rules, Shropshire's Steve Brookshaw prepared the New Zealand-bred horse so well that it galloped past the winning post at Aintree by 25 lengths, the largest winning margin since Red Rum's third win 20 years earlier.
But 1997 was also the year when the National had to be postponed because of a bomb scare. After several hours of confusion and delay, not to mention much deliberation, the race was run 48 hours later, on the Monday teatime. And, sadly, that's how it will always be best remembered.
"It was my 15 minutes of fame," Brookshaw told BBC Sport. "The biggest day of my life.
"A lot of people in Shrewsbury came round that night to see us home, there were bottles of champagne on the lawn and we had a bit of a party. Our social life picked up tremendously.
"We had a great social life for the next 12 months. We went down to the Dorchester Hotel in London for various do's and dances, as it had been the 150th National. Lord Gyllene even went down with us for one of them.
"But the race itself was obviously overshadowed by the fact that it was on the Monday after the bomb scare."
Lord Gyllene was comparable to Red Rum
Brookshaw maintains, however, that but for the bomb - or rather no bomb - and the injuries that followed the nine-year-old's Aintree triumph on 7 April 1997, the horse himself could have gone on to even better things.
"I've not seen many horses do it that easy," said Brookshaw. "Except Red Rum, when he was in his prime. And even he got beat once or twice.
"His two previous races were over four miles and nearly four miles (the National is run over four miles 514 yards) so there were no doubts about him staying. He'd had two hard races, so it was just a case of keeping him fresh. It was lovely to see his ears pricked coming past the line. He won by 25 lengths so could have carried a bit more weight and still won.
"We knew he'd do well. He was ideal for the National. My wife Zena used to ride him out most of the time and he was a real gentleman. You could not have had a better horse for the race. He loved the place."
Steve Brookshaw now works at Richard Kent's Mickley Stud, near Tern Hill, Market Drayton
Brookshaw's winners 'over the National fences'
Steve Brookshaw trained winners in all three of the only races run over the famous Grand National fences at the Aintree Festival.
1996 - Rolling Ball (Foxhunters' Open Hunters' Chase)
1997 - Lord Gyllene (Grand National)
1999 - Listen Timmy (Topham Chase)
2004 - Cassia Heights (Topham Chase)
Both the Foxhunters' Chase, run on the Thursday, and the Topham Chase, run on the Friday, are run just once round the course, as opposed to the two circuits in the Grand National.
Saturday's trip to Aintree
"I was only in my second season with a licence to train and it was all pretty new to me and, other than feeling nervous, everything had gone to plan when we set out from Shropshire that Saturday morning," explained Brookshaw.
"The owner, Sir Stanley Clarke, was taking no risks and, as the horse was so well fancied, he'd insisted on having nightwatchmen patrol the yard for a week before the race. He didn't want anyone to get to him.
"But, by the time we got home that night, that had had all gone out of the window.
"We were lucky that, although they had switched off phone signals on the course, Jim Mellow, the man who brought the horse for Stan Clarke, had a New Zealand phone so we were able to use that and get things organised. There was a only a bit of panicking and drove back the 60-odd miles to Shropshire that night.
"The organisers consulted a lot of people, including us trainers, and the groundswell of opinion was that everyone wanted to run on the Monday. They certainly handled it a lot better than the Esha Ness race four years earlier. It didn't help the nerves though. We didn't get much sleep over the whole of that three days."
Lord Gyllene had a good following to escort him to the winner's enclosure at Aintree
Monday's trip to Aintree
"Tony Dobbin had told me what he wanted to do and I agreed with him," continued Brookshaw. "He said he wanted to make the running, he'd done his homework and he knew what he was doing. He took lengths off the field at the Canal Turn and he dealt very well with the one moment of bother he did run into.
"Coming to the Water Jump at the end of the first circuit, a loose horse nearly took out Lord Gyllene but Tony was sharp enough to notice what we has doing and he pulled him back in again.
"It was not until he jumped the last that I felt totally sure he'd do it. It was always a risk going to Aintree and it's just a great relief when they come back safely, but it was still a great moment for everyone on the team. Especially for one of our group.
"On the Saturday, we'd got him in from the local agency in Shrewsbury to feed the horses and let the dogs out. We ended up getting him a ticket for the Monday, so he skived off work and, when the TV cameras picked him out in the owners and trainers stand pulling all these faces after the horse had won, he was interviewed by Des Lynam, who thought he was the winning owner. Really, he was just the dog watcher."
Lord Gyllene's team
Owner, trainer and horse - Steve Brookshaw, Stan Clarke and Lord Gyllene the morning after their 1997 Grand National victory
The horse: Bred in New Zealand, winning twice down under before coming to England after being brought by Stan Clarke in 1995. Was trained at Steve Brookshaw's yard at Preston Farm, Uffington, near Shrewsbury, winning five and being placed in five of his 13 races, seven of them at Uttoxeter, before being retired in 2001. He remained with his owner's family until he died in December 2016 - at 28.
The owner: Staffordshire-born Stan Clarke was a self-made property developer millionaire, who briefly trained horses before becoming a racecourse owner, buying Uttoxeter, his local track, then Brighton, Fontwell Park, Yarmouth, Bath, Hereford and Sedgefield under the Northern Racing banner. Bought Dunstall Hall, now owned by Nottingham Forest owner Fawaz Al Hasawi. Died in September 2004 aged 71.
The trainer: Coming from a long line of horsemen in his family, Steve Brookshaw began his racing career as a jockey who rode 148 point-to-point winners, as well as having 25 winners under National Hunt rules. Took out a training licence in 1996, enjoying an Aintree winner in his first season, prior to Lord Gyllene's success in 1997. Now 66, and works on a stud farm in North Shropshire.
The jockey: Northern Irishman Tony Dobbin rode over 1,200 winners in his career, of which winning the National in 1997 was the highlight. Rode mostly for Nicky Richards, son of Shropshire-owned One Man's trainer Gordon Richards, at his yard at Greystoke, near Penrith, Cumbria, where he met his future wife Rose. Retired from racing in 2008. Now 44 and helping to run his wife's yard in Northumberland.
Tony Dobbin's 1997 Grand National win was the biggest of his 1,200-plus winning rides as a jockey
So why did Brookshaw get out of racing?
Within a decade of Lord Gyllene's win, Brookshaw had packed in the racing game. But why?
"We weren't making enough money," he says with great honesty. "If you won the National every year you might do well.
"Lord Gyllene was still improving but he had a lot of leg trouble. Twice we aimed him at Aintree again but he we had to pull him out each time and we never quite got him back up to his peak. He'd done quite a bit of racing back in his days in New Zealand and so much racing takes its toll in the end eventually.
"To make money and survive, you have to win big races and you need good horses and we just weren't getting the material to work with. It was best to get out and go down another route.
"Unfortunately, a lot of people who own horses don't really know about horses, don't know what can go wrong and how long for. You have a lot of explaining to do several times over. Owners end up thinking 'can someone else do a better job?' But that's why you often see a horse go round several trainers. It's usually because the horse itself wasn't good enough in the first place.
"I don't really miss it. I was putting myself under too much pressure," admits Brookshaw, who still rides out daily, for his daughter. "I like a nice quieter life."
Steve and Zena Brookshaw's daughter Heidi now trains on her own, mostly for point-to-point races
Carrying on the Brookshaw family tradition
Steve Brookshaw comes from a great Shropshire racing family. His father Peter won the Foxhunters Chase over the National fences on Hillmere in 1950 and his uncle Tim was champion jockey in 1958-59 before ending his racing days after a bad fall at Aintree in 1963. Steve himself even rode the Aintree fences in the Foxhunters on Solar Green in 1995.
Now he has his hopes for his daughter Heidi, who trains in an adjoining yard, Helshaw Grange, to where her father is now based, at Richard Kent's Mickley Stud, Brookshaw's old home in North Shropshire.
"My father farmed here," said Brookshaw. "He then retired and sold the farm and now I'm helping out Richard out as I know the place."
Heidi has already trained plenty of runners, including two winners, both at Cheltenham with Sam Cavallaro, who fell at Becher's Brook in the Foxhunters Chase, on the opening day of this year's Aintree Festival on Thursday.
"We've had horses all our lives. If she wants to carry on, she might have to go professional. There's very little money in point-to-pointing. It's done for the love of the game. Same training costs without getting the rewards. She had a winner the other week. The owner had been waiting two years. He was delighted.
"It's a lot more competitive at Aintree now. It's very hard to get in now. Back in 1997, half the field were there just for a run round but now there's a lot of horses in with a chance, a better-class horse. But, if Heidi managed to get one good enough to enter for the National, now that would be something." Cliffs Of Moher justified his favourite status with victory on his return to action in the Dee Stakes at Chester.
Ryan Moore positioned the Galileo colt, priced at 4-5, just behind the pace-setting Max Zorin before moving through in the final furlong.
Cliffs Of Moher, in his first race for 195 days, finished a length and half ahead of Bay Of Poets, with Max Zorin third and Mirage Dancer fourth.
The victory was trainer Aidan O'Brien's sixth in the Dee Stakes.
It continued a fantastic run for O'Brien, as his horses filled the first three places in the Chester Vase on Thursday after saddling Winter to victory in Sunday's 1,000 Guineas and Churchill in Saturday's 2,000 Guineas.
Cliffs Of Moher was immediately cut to a best-priced 7-1 for the Epsom Derby on 3 June.
Share this page Montaly got up in a tight finish to give trainer Andrew Balding and jockey Oisin Murphy a first Chester Cup win.
The 16-1 shot collared Yorkidding by a neck, with Fun Mac third and Who Dares Wins fourth.
Earlier, Enable - under Frankie Dettori for trainer John Gosden - won the Cheshire Oaks from favourite Alluringly.
The winner is now rated about an 8-1 chance for the Oaks at Epsom next month.
Enable had previously finished third behind stable companion and fellow Khalid Abdullah-owned filly Shutter Speed at Newbury.
However, Abdullah's racing manager Teddy Grimthorpe hinted Shutter Speed could miss Epsom for the French Oaks, depending on how she performs in the Musidora Stakes at York next week.
"We're pretty confident Enable will stay a mile and a half, but there is a question mark about Shutter Speed," he said.
Montaly, racing for the first time in 186 days, later came from behind to snatch victory.
"It's some job to get this horse to win this race," said Murphy. "You've got to remember he's been off the track a long time and he was on a career-high mark, so credit to Andrew and the team. Trainer Aidan O'Brien's winning run continued as his horses filled the first three places in the Chester Vase, with Venice Beach victorious.
The 5-2 favourite, ridden by Ryan Moore, beat Wings Of Eagles, with The Anvil a nose further back in third.
O'Brien said all three could run in next month's Epsom Derby, for which Venice Beach is rated fifth favourite.
"I thought it was a very good performance. We are still learning an awful lot about him," said Moore.
On Sunday, Winter won the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket to give O'Brien a third double in the Guineas - following Saturday's victory with Churchill.
The trainer also won both Classics in 2005 and 2012.
5 live Racing podcast: Aidan O'Brien on his Guineas double
Analysis
BBC Sport horse racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght
Venice Beach, another son of super stallion Galileo, won this like a useful performer - though it was his third run of the year - and the eye-catcher was perhaps Wings Of Eagles, racing for the first time in 2017, who was, as they say, doing his best work towards the end of the race.
O'Brien was non-committal about any 'pecking order', but to be fair he's got important potential Derby runners Cliffs Of Moher and Sir John Lavery in action in the coming days.
His Epsom team, however, looks more formidable than ever.  The newly expanded group phase of the African Champions League, featuring 16 teams this season, kicked off on Friday with a strong start for Tunisian clubs.
Etoile du Sahel, who are the only club to have won all five present and past continental club competitions, proved too strong for debutants Ferroviario Beira of Mozambique, winning 5-0 in Sousse in Group A.
Another Tunisian side, Esperance, began the new era of African Champions League football with a 3-1 win over DR Congo's AS Vita Club in Rades in Group C.
African Champions League fixtures:
Group A:	Group B:
Fri: Etoile du Sahel 5-0 Ferroviario Beira	Fri: USM Alger 3-0 Al Ahly Tripoli
Fri: Al Hilal 1-1 Al Merreikh	Fri: Zamalek 2-0 CAPS Utd
Group C:	Group D:
Fri: Esperance 3-1 AS Vita Club	Sat: Al Ahly v Zanaco
Sat: Mamelodi Sundowns v St George	Sun: Wydad Casablanca 2-0 Coton Sport
In other matches on Friday, Nigerian Stanley Okawuchi scored a late goal as Zamalek of Egypt beat CAPS United of Zimbabwe 2-0 in Alexandria.
Several squandered chances and acrobatic saves from CAPS goalkeeper Edmore Sibanda kept the Group B clash goalless until half-time at the Borg Al Arab Stadium.
But Sibanda was at fault for both goals with Basem Morsy giving 2016 runners-up Zamalek the lead on 56 minutes and Nigeria's Stanley Okawuchi scoring seven minutes from time.
Zamalek lie second on goal difference in Group B after USM Alger of Algeria trounced Al Ahly Tripoli of Libya 3-0 in Algiers.
Headed goals from Farouk Chafai and Madagascan Carolus Andriamatsinoro gave 2015 runners-up USM a two-goal cushion by the break.
Oussama Darfalou completed the rout seven minutes from time by finding space inside the box and firing a low shot into the corner of the net.
On Saturday, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa continue the defence of their title as they host Ethiopia's Saint George.
Sundowns' coach Pitso Mosimane (pictured) says fixture fatigue could threaten their hopes.
Last year they became just the second South African winners of Africa's top club competition, beating Zamalek of Egypt 3-1 on aggregate in the final.
Mosimane, who played for and coached South Africa, says a fixture pile-up could affect his team.
"The Saint George players are sitting in the stand, resting and watching us," he said after a midweek domestic match in Pretoria.
"It is not easy fighting on the South African and African fronts. We are playing every three days or so and injuries and suspensions can wreck plans.The 52-year-old also accepts his side Sundowns have lost the element of surprise they enjoyed last year.
"That advantage has gone. Rivals clubs know who we are now and watch us on TV," he conceded.
"But we are more experienced than last year, have greater quality and depth in our squad, and know what Champions League football is all about."
Saint George, the first club from Ethiopia to make the group phase, won all four of their qualifiers and five-goal Saladin Said is the leading Champions League scorer this season.
Also on Saturday, eight-time winners Al Ahly of Egypt will be wary of Zanaco having come unstuck against another Zambian club, Zesco United, in the group stage last year, dropping five points. Manchester United's Eric Bailly could have his European ban extended after Uefa opened disciplinary proceedings over his red card against Celta Vigo.
The Ivory Coast defender, 23, was dismissed after a brawl in the final minutes of United's Europa League semi-final aggregate victory on Thursday.
A direct red card carries a one-match ban - which means he will miss the final - but Uefa will determine whether to extend that at a hearing on 20 July.
His case does not qualify for appeal.
European football's governing body only overturns decisions made by the referee in cases of mistaken identity.
Bailly was sent off for a swipe at Celta's former Manchester City striker John Guidetti, with Facundo Roncaglia dismissed for retaliating.
Speaking on Friday, manager Jose Mourinho said Bailly would play in the club's three remaining Premier League fixtures to "give a rest to some of the others".
United play Dutch side Ajax in the Europa League final on Wednesday, 24 May. Victory would guarantee a place in next season's Champions League.
The club's final game of the domestic season is at home against Crystal Palace, three days before the match in Stockholm. Nottingham Forest striker Britt Assombalonga has reiterated his desire to play international football for DR Congo.
He was talking after helping his side avoid relegation from the Championship.
The 24-year-old is keen to play for the Leopards despite rejecting the chance to go with them to the Africa Cup of Nations in January to concentrate on his club career.
"I was born in Congo so that's where I want to play," he told the BBC Sport.

Nottingham Forest striker Britt Assombalonga is still keen to follow in his father's footsteps and play for DR Congo.
"My dad played there so it's not really difficult. People might say its the easy way but that's where I was born, that's where my family is from."
His father Fedor Assombalonga is a former DR Congo international and his brother Christian plays in the lower English leagues.
He was born in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa and came to England with his family when he was eight months old and is proud of his heritage.
"I am African and I want to show people that they can pick to go and play for a team in Africa and that's what I have done, that's what I have chosen," he insisted.
"It's good for me because I am proud to say I am African, I am proud to say I am from Congo and that's the team I would like to play for."
Assombalonga was the hero for Forest last weekend as he scored twice in their final game of the season against Ipswich to ensure his side were not relegated.
"This weekend was special but nervy. I wouldn't call it a big achievement because you never want to be in that position," he explained.
"It's nice to see everyone excited because we didn't get relegated but as a player, as a coach you never want to be in that position." Zesco United are aiming to become the first Zambian winners of the Confederation Cup after they reached the semi-finals of the Champions League last year.
They are one of 16 teams in the group stage of the Confederation Cup that begins this weekend.
Zesco open their Group C campaign at home to Egypt's Smouha on Saturday.
"If we believe in each other we can lift the trophy," said striker John Ching'andu.
The 23-year-old scored twice as Zesco reached the expanded group phase by beating Enugu Rangers of Nigeria 3-0 at home.
United had also shown spirit in the first leg as they recovered from two goals behind to force a 2-2 draw.
Confederation Cup fixtures:
Group A:	Group B:
Sat: FUS Rabat v KCCA	Sat: CS Sfaxien v Mbabane Swallows
Sun: Club Africain v Rivers Utd	Sun: Platinum Stars v Mouloudia Alger
Group C:	Group D:
Sat: Zesco Utd v Smouha	Fri: SuperSport Utd 2-2 Horoya
Sun: Recreativo Libolo v Al Hilal Obeid	Sun: TP Mazembe v CF Mounana
Serbian coach Zlatko Krmpotic shares the optimism of Ching'andu.
"Smouha are a good team who I know from my days as assistant coach of TP Mazembe in the Democratic Republic of Congo," he said.
"We beat them 2-0 away and 1-0 at home in the Caf Champions League, but they were no pushovers and deserve respect."

 Dustin Johnson
Dustin Johnson hit a drive of 428 yards at the Tournament of Champions in Hawaii in January
One of the game's most influential leaders has admitted the modern golf ball travels too far for the good of the sport.
Mike Davis is chief executive of the United States Golf Association (USGA), which, along with the St Andrews-based R&A, sets the rules of the game.
In recent decades, courses all over the world have been forced to expand to accommodate the vast distances generated by modern players. They are helped by drivers with large sweet-spots and balls that spin less and travel further.
Many courses have been rendered obsolete for the professional game because they are simply too short. Others, such as the Old Course at St Andrews, need to use tees outside the boundaries of the course to create the requisite distance to make holes sufficiently testing.
Former greats including Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Greg Norman insist the ball is travelling too far. Indeed Nicklaus, an 18-time major champion, told BBC Sport last year: "It is the most ridiculous thing in the game."
Yet the authorities have done nothing to shorten the distance a ball flies. They appear accepting of the status quo, and the R&A and USGA published recent data they claim proves that length off the tee has plateaued.
This may be the case, however few tournament weeks go by without stories of professionals dispatching drives more than 400 yards.
Current leading PGA average driving distances
1) Dustin Johnson (US) - 316.2 yards
2) Luke List (US) - 312 yards
3) Andrew Loupe (US) - 311.1 yards
Tour average: 289.7 yards
Source: PGA Tour
And Davis has now admitted there is a problem with distance. In a wide-ranging interview with US online magazine Golfworld, he said: "My biggest regret would be what has happened with distance.
"It's been the thing, probably more than any, that has been the most harmful to the game. Billions of dollars have been spent to alter golf courses - and for what?"
Davis acknowledges manufacturers do not want to make equipment that is less powerful, and players love to see their ball travel long distances.
"Nobody wants to hit the ball shorter," he said. "On the other hand, increased distance has had a profoundly negative effect on golf courses.
"They've had to expand, they've had to use more resources to maintain. It takes more time to play. It takes more land and construction costs for new golf courses.
"And, in some cases, architectural integrity has been compromised. Are any of these things good?
"I sometimes wish we could just snap our fingers and say: 'We're going to roll the entire golf world back on distance.' But the stark reality is that would be chaotic and would likely not be supported by the masses."
And this is why we should not expect much change in the coming years, despite the overwhelming logic that says a shorter game would make the sport cheaper and more attractive.
Rory McIlroy at this year's Masters
Rory McIlroy was ninth on last year's PGA Tour list, with an average of 306 yards
Indeed, European Tour chief executive Keith Pelley argues fans love to see the likes of Rory McIlroy propel drives more than 350 yards. He believes it is a genuine spectacle.
And when fans stand around tournament tees and witness such prodigious hitting, their awe is audible.
Davis, though, believes it is incumbent upon the rules-makers to at least discuss the issue.
"We've really not talked about it," he said. "But with the R&A and the USGA's responsibility to look out to the future, there's a genuine interest to say: 'Maybe we won't get there, but shame on us if we don't at least talk about it.'"
During the lengthy interview, Davis raised a number of issues pertinent to the running of courses at the level of the humble amateur.
In the UK, we are entering a period of the year when our greens start to be shaved to maximise speed, and rough is grown as fairways are narrowed.
From personal experience, these developments tend to be welcomed but, post-round, many club golfers feel beaten by tricky, penal course set-ups.
Davis, who has been laying out US Open courses since 2006, sympathises with those for whom the game is rendered too difficult.
"When I talk to architects, for about 40 years, hard equalled good," he said.
"Now you're definitely seeing that go in the other direction, where fun equals good. These practices of narrower fairways, higher rough, not encouraging play from the proper tees, it's no good.
"Today, people equate fast greens with good greens. But fast greens cost more to maintain. Fast greens are more susceptible to disease.
"Fast greens compromise some of the architectural integrity of great courses. Fast greens have absolutely caused more cases of the yips. And they've hurt pace of play."
Davis also contends that fairway grass tends to be cut too short, leaving tighter lies that make ball-striking and chipping more difficult.
"Growing up, we didn't hear about people skulling chip shots," the 52-year-old said. "Now you hear about the chip yips. So we've been trying to message: 'Keep your fairways drier, but longer.'"
Whether this message is heard by golf clubs of the world remains to be seen.
But on the key issue of distance, Davis has shown he does have ears and has listened to the argument that the ball travels too far.
Furthermore, he clearly accepts the logic. The problem is, it seems too late to do anything about it. Masters quiz: What did former champions serve at their champions dinner?

Hugs with Arnie, starstruck by Jack and missing Seve.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the BBC first broadcasting the Masters from the Augusta National in Georgia and some familiar names have shared their memories of playing in, watching and commentating on one of the world's most iconic sporting events.
Peter Alliss played in the first Masters covered by the BBC in 1967, having also contested the previous year's tournament and although he was initially unimpressed as a player, he has grown fond of the place since becoming a commentator.
Arnie's hug - Peter Alliss, BBC TV commentator
Playing there wasn't a happy experience for me. I realised that you weren't really made to feel welcome back in the 1960s. That goes against everything they say today.
You had to have a local caddie. The locals didn't want to caddie as they felt you had little chance of doing well and hence they had little chance of getting a good tip. It was very overpowering. From my point of view, I was overawed by the whole thing.
But I have marvelled at the place since. It is fearless when it comes to innovation. And when you go out in front of the clubhouse where they sit under the big trees, you see the famous faces from days gone by. Some are missing, some new ones come, some never change.
Two years ago I was walking and the late Arnold Palmer was there. We were great friends since the 1950s. He gave me a big hug in front of hundreds of people, they had no idea who I was. It's just people. The people for me make it. There's just a general feeling that it's just different.

1986 Masters: Jack Nicklaus wins 18th major aged 46
One thing an interviewer should never be is starstruck. The other crime is failing to listen to what the interviewee is telling you.
I was guilty on both counts during my first visit to Augusta in 1993. It was under the famous tree outside the clubhouse where I first interviewed my all-time golfing hero Jack Nicklaus.
Among a scrum of reporters I thrust my microphone under the great man's nose and he explained that he would likely miss that year's Open because of an ongoing hip problem.
Agog at being in this position I was determined not to dry up so instead of listening, my mind was on what I should ask him next. Sadly the question I chose was: "So will we see you at the Open in July?"
Naturally Nicklaus replied in the most clipped terms: "I just answered that."
End of interview, and very important lessons were learned via the greatest golfer of all time.

Golf great Ballesteros dies at 54
The year 1957 was special for golf, not because of achievements in the sport but for the golfers who came into the world. Along with Sir Nick Faldo and Bernhard Langer, Spaniard Seve Ballesteros made his appearance.
Sixty years on we remember Seve on 9 April which would have been his 60th birthday. Seve and Augusta were a match made in heaven, like strawberries and cream, leaving us with so many memories. His first green jacket in 1980 opened the doors for fellow Europeans to follow in his footsteps. And his second followed in 1983.
After retiring from playing he occasionally joined the BBC commentary team, bringing with him the same passion and enthusiasm that he had on the course.
On one of his visits to Augusta, I interviewed him for part of the BBC preview programme; he was staying in the house he had rented there for many previous Masters weeks. At the end of the interview his son surprised him with a birthday cake. He was obviously moved by the thoughtfulness.
We will all be thinking of him on Sunday as the final round takes place. I have no doubt he will be sharing some cake with Arnie and loving the golf. We miss you.

Masters 2014: Sandy Lyle wins Britain's first Green Jacket
There are plenty of memorable moments, not least watching Phil Mickelson threading his second shot between the trees off the pinestraw at the 13th on his way to his third Green Jacket in 2010. Wow, when that ball hit the green, I jumped so far out of my seat in the studio that I nearly landed in the azaleas bordering the set!
But one of the things that will always stay with me was when I first clapped eyes on Augusta National for real. It was a proper, 'pinch me' moment.
Off I strode and immediately sought out 'Sandy's bunker' at the 18th. That was where, in 1988, Sandy Lyle had driven his tee shot. He had needed a par at the last to force a play-off with Mark Calcavecchia.
I remember thinking back then in '88 that he'd blown it. But out came the famous seven iron, and Sandy would hoist the ball up and on to the green before sinking the putt for a birdie to become the first British player to win the Masters.
So years later, there I stood, looking into the impossibly white sand of that bunker and gazing up at the very large hill that lies in front of it up to the green. The contours of the course really don't translate properly on TV. So, standing there in person underscored to me what a fantastic shot it really was.
I had interviewed Sandy many times at other courses but to do so that year, in situ and with a bit of 'local knowledge' now in place, was a proper thrill.

Masters 2013: Tiger Woods stays in the hunt
The first year I worked on the Masters was 2013, the year that Tiger Woods' ball hit the pin on 15 and rolled back into the water and he dropped in the incorrect spot. Tiger has long been one of my sporting heroes and I was shaking with nerves in anticipation of having to interview him, for the first time, on the Saturday evening with controversy surrounding his status in the tournament.
In the meantime I had entered the draw, open to members of the media, to play Augusta on the Monday after the event finishes and was waiting to find out if I was one of the very lucky few to be pulled out of the hat.
Tiger walked into the interview room and I said to my director: "Tiger's all set to go." I was told to ask him to wait for a minute so that we could broadcast the interview live. Tiger was happy but the wait seemed like an eternity and the director could tell I was nervous and uncomfortable.
So he started counting me down untilwe went live... 50 seconds, 40 seconds... when we got to 30 seconds he said: "Oh by the way Rish, the draw for the media day is out and you're in, you're playing."
I'd forgotten how nervous I was about interviewing the great man and was now excited about playing the greatest golf course in the world. I began to wonder how I would get my hands on a set of clubs and shoes to play.
Meanwhile, the countdown to the interview continued "10 seconds Rish... six, five, by the way I was just kidding about golf on Monday, three, two, one and cue Rishi, live with Tiger".
Naturally I fumbled my first question, although that doesn't make the cut in the video above!

My first, official, practice round in 2004 was with Jack Nicklaus. I'd known the Nicklaus family for a number of years but I was incredibly honoured for that invitation. Jack and I met on the practice ground and shared a few laughs before heading to the first tee. I recall the unrelenting enthusiasm from his fans and they even shared some excitement in meeting me.
I knew that I wasn't the star that day but everyone made me feel like Jack's equal. I knew better. The day was, mostly, like any other as both of us charted the course preparing like tour pros do.
Jack gave me advice and talked a lot about his last win in 1986. As we approached the green on 17, where the famous "yessir" call came, he told me that he hit the same putt in 1987 and it broke, surprisingly, a different way.
Upon completing the round we took pictures with my newly-born son, Dade, shook hands and said our goodbyes. To me, that was a once-in-a-lifetime moment. I'll be forever grateful for that April day at my first Masters.
'Pinch yourself' Augusta - Jay Townsend, BBC Radio 5 live summariser
Rory McIlroy plays out of the azaleas in 2014
The golfers do not always appreciate the azaleas as much as the watching patrons
The hidden secrets of Augusta National are many and you only realise the significance once you step foot on the grounds.
My first trip to the Masters was as a guest of friend and former champion Craig Stadler in 1995. Most, if not all avid golfers, grow up watching the Masters on television, and you think you know it from the years of watching the excitement. I can tell you that you cannot begin to imagine what it is like to see it in person.
The hills are larger and steeper than you thought, the colour of the flowers, azaleas, and dogwoods are more intense than you remember from the broadcasts, the green of the grass is like nothing you have ever seen before.
And the amazing thing is, I feel these same emotions every single year when I walk out to see the course on Wednesday morning of Masters week. It is a "pinch yourself" moment that you are so lucky to be there. Masters 2017: Serene Sergio Garcia may have unlocked the secret to winning majors

Masters 2017: Why Sergio Garcia's win was so special
Serenity was a word that sprang to mind throughout the epic Masters that spawned Sergio Garcia's maiden major victory.
The 37-year-old broke through thanks to an apparent inner peace that enabled him to cope with all that Augusta and the elements could throw at him.
Whether it was the gusty winds of the first two days or the intimidating last-day surge of Justin Rose as he collected a hat-trick of front-nine birdies, Garcia remained unperturbed in becoming the only man to be sub-par in all four rounds.
It is a state of mind that was beyond the Spaniard in pretty much all of his previous 73 attempts to win a major.
"I felt very calm," Garcia said during his champion's news conference. "I felt very at ease."
Is Garcia's win the perfect sporting story?

Sitting there in his newly won Green Jacket, it seemed Garcia had finally found the secret - a key to unlock the major puzzle. And it could equip him well in his quest to ensure he does not become a one-hit wonder at major level.
This was particularly apparent when he recounted the events of the par-five 13th in his final round on Sunday. He had bogeyed the 10th and 11th and now his drive caught a tree and dropped into an unplayable position beneath a bush.
Commentating on BBC Radio 5 live, I suggested we were witnessing another major implosion from a player burdened by a suffocating desire to land the most glamorous of golf's top four prizes.

Garcia wins play-off to take Green Jacket
How wrong can one be? Garcia's response, to conjure a par before going birdie and eagle over the next two holes, was stunning.
"In the past, I would have started going at my caddie," Garcia admitted. "And oh, you know, why doesn't it go through [the tree's branches] and whatever.
"But I was like, well, if that's what is supposed to happen, let it happen. Let's try to make a great five here and see if we can put in a hell of a finish to have a chance.
Sergio Garcia shakes hands with Padraig Harrington after the latter wins the Open in a play-off at Carnoustie in 2007
Garcia lost the 2007 Open to Padraig Harrington in a play-off - the first of the Irishman's three majors in two seasons
"And if not, we'll shake Justin's hand and congratulate him for winning.
"So I think I did that very well throughout the whole week, and it's something I need to keep improving and keep getting better at it."
If he is able to regularly harness this new outlook, he will become a formidable force at future majors.
A better mental attitude would work in tandem with impressive physical conditioning that shows no sign of deterioration. Garcia had played 71 consecutive majors heading into the Masters.
That speaks volumes for his longevity and consistency at the top of the game despite several relative troughs before this standout peak in his career graph.
Now he is entitled to feel as though he can swiftly become a multiple major champion in the way Padraig Harrington did a decade ago.
Garcia was twice the fall-guy when the Irishman claimed his three crowns, starting with victory in 2007 at Carnoustie, where the Spaniard narrowly missed a putt for victory.
Harrington retained his Open crown at Birkdale a year later before beating Garcia to the PGA title at Oakland Hills the following month.

Garcia celebrates winning the famed Green Jacket with his fiancee Angela Akins
This year the Open returns to Birkdale and the Masters champion can draw on another piece of history to fuel his hopes of snatching the Claret Jug.
In 1998, Mark O'Meara, who was four years older than Garcia is now, claimed his first major with a thrilling Masters triumph. Later that year he went to the Merseyside course and doubled his major tally.
Whether Garcia can emulate such a feat is subject to many factors - the form of rivals, the state of his game and how the draw is affected by seaside weather.
But there is no doubt he is better equipped to deal with the mental tests that come during the biggest tournaments.
Already a winner of the Players' Championship, Garcia has now won at every level of the game.

Masters 2017: Rickie Fowler & Matt Kuchar feature in shots of the tournament
That might be it for him. Darren Clarke found a similar serenity to win the 2011 Open and it proved his crowning moment.
Yet Garcia, I sense, is more likely to kick on from this triumph and find ways to retain this successful state of mind. If he does, prepare for some thrilling jousts against Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy and, yes, Sunday's runner-up Rose.
The Englishman, no doubt, feels this was a Masters that got away. His missed putts on the 13th and 17th let open the door to major glory, which Garcia was finally ready to charge through.
It was a thrilling and memorable Masters and one that may leave quite a legacy. Two amateur runners who provided the defining image of this year's London Marathon will be reunited at the upcoming Great Manchester Run.
Matthew Rees of Wales stopped 300 metres from the end to help Englishman David Wyeth, who was struggling with exhaustion, over the line.
"It'll be great to see David again - in happier circumstances," said Rees.
The pair will compete in the 10k event, which is broadcast live on BBC One, on Sunday, 28 May.
The two men had never met before April's London Marathon, but have communicated regularly since Rees generously stopped for Wyeth, who is from Manchester.
The pair eventually finished in two hours 52 minutes 26 seconds - with Rees losing scores of places in the race running order to come 986 in the men's overall.
Rees said he was just lending a hand to a "guy in need", but his actions drew praise from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry, race officials and many social media users.
Marathon runner stops for 'guy in need'
'It's just being human, isn't it?' - runners recall special moment
Why do some runners get 'jelly legs'?Adam Gemili says Britain's sprint strength means just getting in the team would make him a strong medal contender at August's World Championships.
Gemili, 23, finished fourth in the 200m at Rio 2016, just three thousandths of a second away from a bronze medal.
However Jamaica-based duo Zharnel Hughes and Miguel Francis are among fierce competition for the two spots on offer at July's British team trials.
"Making that team - you'll know you are among the world's best," said Gemili.
"It is going to be really difficult. The depth is great and everyone is going to have to be in good shape for the trials because nothing is given."
Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, the second-fastest Briton of all time over 200m after a run of 19.95 seconds in May 2016, Olympic semi-finalist Danny Talbot and promising 21-year-old Reece Prescod are some of the other contenders for a place in the British team.Eliud Kipchoge missed out on becoming the first athlete to run under two hours for the marathon by 26 seconds.
The Kenyan, 32, clocked 2:00.25 but because in-out pacemakers were used, the time will not be recognised as a world record, meaning Dennis Kimetto's mark of 2:02.57 is still the quickest.
But Kipchoge said: "This is history."
Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia also raced in the behind-closed-doors Nike event in Italy but faded earlier in the attempt.

The three athletes chased the landmark time running 2.4km laps on the Monza Grand Prix circuit, 63 years to the day since Britain's Roger Bannister ran the first ever sub four-minute mile.
Monza was chosen by the sportswear company for its gentle corners and favourable climatic conditions. Small groups of pacemakers ran pre-defined segments of the circuit before handing over to another group, and the trio did not have to slow down for feed stations as drinks were delivered by scooter.

Small groups of pacemakers ran pre-defined segments of the circuit before handing over to another group, and the trio did not have to slow down for feed stations as drinks were delivered by scooter.
Kipchoge ran each mile at an average pace of around four minutes and 36 seconds. To achieve a sub-two clocking, the Olympic champion would have effectively had to run 17 seconds for 100 metres 422 times in a row.
He lapped 27-year-old Desisa, who finished in 2:14.10, while Tadese, 35, came home in 2:06.51. Kipchoge always looked the stronger and was on target pace with around seven miles to go but he began grimacing in the closing stages and though he tried to sprint up the home straight, his fatigue was obvious.
Pacemakers applauded and encouraged him as he approached the line and the clocking comfortably outstrips his recognised personal best of 2:03.05, set at the London Marathon in 2016.
"I'm happy to have run two hours for the marathon," added Kipchoge. "My mind was fully on the two hours but the last kilometre was behind the schedule. This journey has been good - it has been seven months of dedication."
Women's world-record holder Paula Radcliffe called Kipchoge's run "truly inspiring".
Only a select few media were allowed in to witness the attempt at the race circuit near Milan and Kipchoge's time was initially reported to be a second quicker until Nike confirmed the 2:00.25 clocking.
The brand paid the three runners to forgo the London and Berlin Marathons this year prompting some criticism of the event given the resources invested and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record.
Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting.
Eliud Kipchoge is, I believe, the greatest physical specimen ever to line up on a marathon start line. If he can't run sub-two, then I don't see another athlete that will do it any time soon.
Kipchoge ran close to the legitimate world record in London in 2016, and perhaps would have broken it in Berlin the year before if his shoes that day hadn't lost their insoles.
He's made history of sorts in Monza, and he's right to be proud of pushing the boundaries. What he needs to do now is break the world record on an IAAF-recognised course.
He has the talent to do that and the world record is all that's missing from a phenomenal career.
The 23-year-old clocked his sixth sub-10 second time of the season as he came home in 9.99, ahead of Asafa Powell.
Gatlin was fourth in 10.14, behind Femi Ogunode (10.13) and ahead of De Grasse, who was fifth in 10.21.
Jamaica's Olympic champion Elaine Thompson beat the Netherlands' Dafne Schippers in the 200m.
The pair were separated by only a tenth of a second in last year's Olympic final, and Thompson triumphed in Doha by 0.26 seconds in a time of 22.19.
Britain's Robbie Grabarz, who took silver in the European Indoors in March, claimed second place in the high jump, clearing 2.31m in his first outdoor event of the season.
Olympic champion Caster Semenya claimed a commanding victory in the 800m, coming home in a world-leading time of one minute 56.61 seconds.
Burundi's Francine Niyonsaba, who won silver behind the South African in Rio, was the only other woman to better that time in the whole of 2016.
Ethiopia's Genzebe Dibaba - who broke a 22-year-old 1500m world record in 2015 and won silver over the distance in Rio - was fifth in her first 800m outing.
The governing body only wants records to be recognised if they can stand up to strict new criteria, part of attempts to make a clean break with the sport's doping scandals.
As a result, any records set before 2005 are now at risk - almost half of the 146 men's and women's indoor and outdoor records. These include marks that have never been subject to suspicion, prompting an outcry from many of the existing record holders.
Seven of the eight men's field events world records and the women's 100m, 200m, 400m and 800m marks could go.
Olympic champions including Florence Griffith-Joyner, Michael Johnson, Hicham El Guerrouj and Jonathan Edwards will fall off the world record list on to an 'all-time list' if the proposals are ratified by the the sport's governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), in August.
Meanwhile, athletes who have competed after 2005 may soon find themselves with a 'WR' next to their name if the sport's record achievements are - in the words of IAAF chief Lord Coe - "recalibrated".
Edwards' triple jump record of 18.29m, set in 1995, is among the long-standing records under threat.
The Olympic, world and European champion jumped into the history books at the 1995 World Championships in Gothenburg as he became the first man to pass the 18-metre mark. American Christian Taylor, who jumped 18.21m in August 2015, would in all likelihood be promoted to world record holder.
Long-distance runner Paula Radcliffe set a world record of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds in the 2003 London Marathon using two male pacemakers. Her record would be taken by this year's London winner Mary Keitany, who finished in 2:17:01.
Welsh hurdler Colin Jackson set the indoor 60m hurdles world record of 7.30secs in 1994, and Britain can still lay claim - for now - to the 4x200m indoor relay record of 1:21.11, set in Glasgow in 1991 by a team that included Linford Christie, who won Olympic 100m gold the following year.
American sprinter Griffith-Joyner, also known as Flo Jo, won three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Olympics.
The former world champion, who died aged 38 in 1998, still holds the 100m and 200m world records. She ran 10.49secs at the US Olympic trials at the University at Indianapolis in July 1988 and then two months later set the 200m world record of 21.34secs at the Games in South Korea.
Fellow American Carmelita Jeter would potentially move up from second on the all-time 100m list with her 2009 time of 10.64secs.
The European Athletics proposals include scrapping the records of anyone caught doping, even if the record was set outside the time period in which they were proven to be cheating. That could mean Dutch sprinter Dafne Schippers taking the new 200m record with her time of 21.63secs set in 2015. She is currently third on the list but drug cheat Marion Jones' legal time of 21.62secs from 1998 would also be removed from the books.
One of the biggest casualties from the rule change could be Moroccan middle-distance runner El Guerrouj, who stands to lose five world records.
The 42-year-old, who is a double Olympic champion and four-time world champion, is the current 1500m, one mile and 2,000m record holder.
In 1998, in Rome, El Guerrouj broke the 1500m record with a run of three minutes 26 seconds. In 1999, also in Rome, he set a new mark for the mile with a time of 3:43.13 and then later that season he set a new 2,000m record of 4:44.79 minutes in Berlin.
El Guerrouj also holds the indoor 1500m and mile world records, which he set in 1997.
His 1500m mark would go to Kenya's Olympic champion Asbel Kiprop, who would move up from third on the list with a 2015 time that was only 0.69 seconds behind El Guerrouj's record.
More dramatically, American Alan Webb could jump from eighth on the all-time list for the mile to take the record with a time from 2007 that is more than three seconds slower than El Guerrouj's mark.
Australian Craig Mottram would take the 2,000m world record with his time from 2006 of 4:50.76, despite being 10th on the all-time list.
American long jumper Mike Powell, a two-time world champion, set his record of 8.95m 26 years ago at the 1991 Tokyo World Championships, breaking the existing record by five centimetres - Bob Beamon's legendary leap from the Mexico City Olympics that had itself stood for 23 years.
With Powell and Beamon's jumps chalked off and nine-time gold medallist Carl Lewis' jump of 8.87m from 1991 also not eligible, the record would most likely go to another American, Dwight Phillips, who would move up from fifth with his 2009 leap of 8.74m.
Three-time Olympic javelin champion Jan Zelezny, a rival of Britain's Steve Backley, threw 98.48m in Germany in 1996. His world record is still more than five metres further than the second best throw of all time. Kenya's Julius Yego currently has the third best of all time but his 92.72m throw in 2015 would be in line to take top spot under the new criteria.
Four-time Olympic gold medallist Johnson has already lost his 200m world record to Jamaican superstar Usain Bolt and his 400m mark to South Africa's Wayde van Niekerk and could be about to lose a third.
Johnson was part of the US team that ran a time of 2:54.39 in the 4x400m relay at the 1993 World Championships. Harry Reynolds, Andrew Valmon and Quincy Watts made up the quartet.
Ethiopian long-distance runner Kenenisa Bekele is a three-time Olympic and five-time world champion and also the 5,000m and 10,000m record holder. It's the former record that he might soon lose as his time of 12:37.55 was set in May 2004. It would go to countryman Dejen Gebremeskel who is fifth on the existing list with 12:46.81, nine seconds off Bekele's record.
American Sanya Richards-Ross would take one of the most controversial records, the women's 400m. That was set in 1985 at 47.60 seconds by Marita Koch, who competed for the former East Germany.
The next four athletes on the current list, including Sydney Olympic champion Cathy Freeman, who ran her best time at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, would also be erased from the record books, leaving Richards' 48.70 as the best time. Only three other runners in the top 20 set their time after 2005 - Allyson Felix in Beijing in 2015 (49.26), Russia's Yuliya Gushchina (49.28) in 2012 and her compatriot Antonina Krivoshapka (49.16) in 2012 - and Krivoshapka was this year revealed to have tested positive for steroid turinabol during the re-examination of samples from London 2012.
Kevin Young is the only man to have run the 400m hurdles in under 47 seconds. His winning time of 46.78secs at the 1992 Olympics could be replaced by fellow American Kerron Clement's 47.24 set in June 2005.
Only two women have broken into the top 20 times in the women's 800m since 2005, and if Jarmila Kratochv?lova of the former Czechoslovakia loses her 1983 record of 1:53.28, Kenya's Pamela Jelimo, third on the list, would be promoted with her 2008 time of 1:54.01.
American Jackie Joyner-Kersee's heptathlon points record of 7,291 from her Olympic gold-medal performance in Seoul in 1988 would be replaced by Carolina Kluft's 7,032 points from 2007. Britain's Jessica Ennis-Hill is currently third on the list.
Paula Radcliffe, Jonathan Edwards and Colin Jackson are among "collateral damage" says European Athletics taskforce chair Pierce O'Callaghan.
But he told BBC Radio 5 live: "There is a bigger picture out there."
All pre-2005 records could be rewritten under the new rules, which need to be ratified by governing body, the IAAF.
O'Callaghan said: "Apologies to the athletes, we never intended to damage their reputation and legacy. It is intended to give the public belief and credibility in what they are watching in the sport."
But BBC athletics commentator and former world 1500m champion Steve Cram called the proposals an "easy route out" and "a PR exercise".
Cram set world records for the 1500m, mile and 2,000m in the space of 19 days in 1985, and still holds the European records for the latter two distances - although under the proposals those pre-2005 European records would join world records in being reset.
He added that the measures are "not going to stop people cheating".
The IAAF (International Association of Athletics Federations) has only stored blood and urine samples since 2005 and current records that do not meet the new criteria would remain on an "all-time list", but not be officially recognised as records if the IAAF accepts the proposal.
European Athletics president Hansen said he would encourage the IAAF to adopt the proposal at its August council meeting, while IAAF president Lord Coe said the changes were "a step in the right direction".
The world records to fall would include Edwards' triple jump mark of 18.29m - set in 1995 - and Jackson's 1994 indoor 60m hurdles world best of 7.30secs, as well as Radcliffe's marathon time of two hours 15 minutes 25 seconds, set in 2003 using two male pacemakers.
O'Callaghan compared the changes to English football introducing the Premier League above the First Division in 1992 and rugby union's Five Nations becoming the Six Nations in 2000, and said the records will be "recalibrated".
"We hope people look at it in that vein, rather than stripping great athletes like Paula of their records," added O'Callaghan, who said he had spoken to Radcliffe and Edwards.
"Unfortunately Paula ran her records in a golden period that happens to be two years before the technology moved on.
"People should not look at Paula's records and throw them in with doping records - she achieved her performance, as did Jonathan, with 100% integrity.
"This is about the bigger picture of reform in athletics and ensuring the public in events like the London World Championships [in August 2017], that they can believe what they are watching."
If the proposals are accepted by the IAAF, a world or European record would only be recognised if it meets all three of the following criteria:
It was achieved at a competition on a list of approved international events where the highest standards of officiating and technical equipment can be guaranteed;
The athlete had been subject to an agreed number of doping control tests in the months leading up to it;
The doping control sample taken after the record was stored and available for re-testing for 10 years.
More than 100 Olympic athletes who competed at the 2008 and 2012 Games have been sanctioned for doping after the International Olympic Committee embarked on a programme of retesting old samples.
Jackson added: "They are making excuses on why they are doing it. I think it is a wrong reason why they are doing it. We all understand the situation with doping but it is not the fault of the clean athletes."
We are all trying to make sure we look at ways we can improve the integrity of our sport but this smacks to me as an easy route out. There are massive issues for the sport to contend with and this, for me, is almost a PR exercise.
I can't believe that if the public don't have credibility now that they are going to have it going forward. I don't think it changes much. It's very confusing for people, and it's going to affect everybody all the way down.
It lumps us all in with those cheats. It's not our fault that over the years the sport did not police itself properly. It's not our fault they didn't do their job. I don't think it's going to change anything. It's not going to stop people cheating.
I was chatting with the president of European Athletics and asked "have you thought this through?". I am not convinced they have. All the member federations of European Athletics will have to scrap their national records because you can't have a national record quicker than the European record, and so on.
Part of the worst aspect of it is that in the document that they are putting forward, they are talking about preserving the dignity of the athletes as well. It's about preserving their own dignity.
It's an easy cop out. They haven't been able to make the tough decisions. If there are records that they believe that shouldn't be on the books then they should go after those with whatever scrutiny they have can. If they can't do that, then this is their problem to deal with.
We all lose our records eventually. It's fine somebody comes along and breaks it but what is not fair is that the federation decides that is not the record any more. As a broadcaster, what do I say to the public?
In the early days, there was no drug testing, did we scrap all of those records? No. Then, drug testing was introduced and now we have tougher drug testing. That's fine, we all accept that. Maybe some things slipped through the net in the past but you can't keep drawing a line every five years.
The farcical thing they are going to end up with, is that there will still be people holding records who have had a ban - but the records they set were before the ban and those will still stand. Somebody fails a test in 2015 and then all of their performances for that period are scrapped. But if they set a record in 2012, that stays. That's silly.
His time of three minutes 59.4 seconds broke both psychological and physiological barriers.
Now, 63 years later, an attempt will be made to shatter another of sport's landmark times - a sub two-hour marathon.
Bannister's mile was a triumph of Corinthian values and spirit.
However, this marathon - to be run in under 120 minutes - is organised by sportswear giant Nike and the event, taking place in northern Italy on Saturday morning, has a distinctly corporate feel about it.
It is the ultimate endurance test, but also one which no fans or broadcast journalists will be able to see.
So is it an expensive PR and marketing exercise?
Or, given its aim to knock close to three minutes off the best time anyone has ever ran 26.2 miles, should it be viewed as a laudable attempt to use sporting excellence and science to push human endurance to dizzying new heights?
The world record for the marathon was set by Kenya's Dennis Kimetto in Berlin in 2014. His time of two hours two minutes 57 seconds is the closest anyone has ever come to going under two hours.
However, it will be not be Kimetto stepping up to this challenge. The job lies instead with his compatriot Eliud Kipchoge, Zersenay Tadese of Eritrea and Lelisa Desisa of Ethiopia.
Kipchoge, as the reigning Olympic marathon champion, perhaps has the greatest chance. His personal best of 2:03.05, set in London in 2016, is impressive and just eight seconds shy of the record.
To break the two-hour marathon barrier, a runner would need to beat the fastest-ever marathon by about 3%. That means they would need to shave seven seconds off each of the race's 26.2 miles.
Therefore, to go under two hours will require a substantial improvement - something that several sports scientists believe is simply beyond what is currently humanly possible.
Nike don't really do perceived wisdom though.
They have signed up the three elite performers, paying them to forego the London and Berlin marathons this season so they can focus their full attention on what the company has branded "Breaking2".
Historical weather patterns have been studied and a three-day window chosen in the belief it will offer optimum conditions.
It has since been narrowed further and so, at 05:45 local time on Saturday morning, the three men will set off in pursuit of a place in history, but not the record books.
This is because of the use of in-out pacemakers, 20 of which will be deployed to keep the pace at a necessary level. Their use is against athletics regulations, so no matter what time is set on Saturday morning, it won't be considered a valid world record.
The pacers will also work in formations to defend the three runners from head or crosswinds.
Nike's legion of scientists, performance coaches, nutritionists and medical staff are also leaving nothing to chance. Mobile ultrasound units have been used to measure glycogen levels in the runners' legs, core temperature pills (an ingestible thermometer that transmits data) are taken by the runners and the latest advances in recovery methods are in use to provide every possible chance of success.
Staff on scooters will deliver energy drinks to the three runners to ensure they don't waste vital seconds slowing down or even slightly veering off course to grab them from roadside tables.
Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting; perhaps laying claim by so doing to a greater sense of authenticity.
But Nike's vice president of special projects, Sandy Bodecker, is perhaps unsurprisingly enthusiastic about the impact that going under two hours will have, even if it is under such controlled conditions.
The attempt is also notable in that the world's media are being blocked from witnessing it. This is very much a behind-closed-doors event, which is unusual given the corporate fanfare it is accompanied by.
There will be no fans lining the steep grandstands that are usually filled by thousands of Formula 1 tifosi on race days.
It suggests that, with everything else under tight control, spectators and journalists would be a distraction from the task at hand. The very early start time, no doubt, presents logistical issues too.
Instead, Nike have allowed a few hand-picked journalists to attend who have also covered the build-up to the big day. A web stream will also provide coverage of the runners on the asphalt track.
Some supporters of the project have called it a "moonshot", given the scale of ambition and the effort expended to get to this point.
So, just like Neil Armstrong's famous first step on the lunar surface in 1969, the world will be required to watch and wonder.
Saturday 6 May is the preferred date, which is also the 63rd anniversary of Roger Bannister breaking the four-minute barrier for the mile.
There are definite parallels. There was plenty of controversy about Bannister's attempt, just as there is about what's happening in Monza.
But an athlete racing against the clock goes to the heart of what the sport has always been. If anyone can do this, it's Eliud Kipchoge.
But that still means him running more than three minutes faster than his current best. The man, not the shoes nor the science, will have to find most of that.
However Jamaica-based duo Zharnel Hughes and Miguel Francis are among fierce competition for the two spots on offer at July's British team trials.
"Making that team - you'll know you are among the world's best," said Gemili.
"It is going to be really difficult. The depth is great and everyone is going to have to be in good shape for the trials because nothing is given."
Sotherton said tweaking events would create "a new slate" and new records.
She said: "Could we go back to yards or run 101m instead of 100m?
"We all know that some of the records are completely out there. But not all of those records were achieved by people who cheated.
"Scrapping those records is unfair on those athletes. And what about my pre-2005 performances? Did they happen? Does this apply to national records too?"
Sotherton referred to the IAAF's decision to remodel the men's javelin in 1986.
Changes were made to the javelin's design because of increasingly frequent flat landings. All existing records were reset after the change, but not erased.
"I am open to the discussion - for the greater good of the sport it's a good thing," she added.
The credibility of records was examined following the sport's doping scandal.
Caleb Ewan narrowly held off the challenge of Fernando Gaviria to win stage seven of the Giro d'Italia, as Geraint Thomas stayed six seconds behind overall race leader Bob Jungels.
Gaviria, who has already won two stages at this year's event, was closely followed by Ireland's Sam Bennett.
It is a first Giro stage win for 22-year-old Australian Ewan.
Thomas retained second behind Jungels after the 224km ride to Alberobello - with fellow Briton Adam Yates third.
Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Friday.
Saturday's stage is a 189km route from Molfetta to Peschici that features a category-two climb about halfway through.

Giro d'Italia 2017: Fernando Gaviria wins stage five after rival celebrates too early
From the sectionCycling

Fernando Gaviria won his second stage at the Giro d'Italia in a sprint finish, after another rider celebrated 'winning' stage five with 6km to go.
Luka Pibernik punched the air as he crossed the finish line - but the route looped back for another lap in Messina.
He only appeared to realise his mistake after the peloton swept past.
Welsh Team Sky rider Geraint Thomas came home safely in the main bunch to stay second overall - six seconds behind race leader Bob Jungels.
Thomas' fellow Briton Adam Yates remains third - 10 seconds behind Jungels - on the same time as defending champion Vincenzo Nibali and 2014 winner Nairo Quintana.
Jakub Mareczko was second behind Gaviria - who also won Sunday's stage three - with Ireland's Sam Bennett third at the end of Wednesday's 159km route from Pessara.
Pibernik eventually finished 148th, 20 seconds slower than Gaviria.
Thursday's sixth stage is a 217km ride from Reggio Calabria to Terme Luigiane that features a category-three climb and a category-four climb.
Gaviria also won Sunday's stage three

Britain's Paula Radcliffe, who faces losing her 2003 marathon world record, called the proposals "cowardly".
"I am hurt and do feel this damages my reputation and dignity," she said, adding that the governing bodies had "again failed clean athletes".
Svein Arne Hansen, the European Athletics president, said world records "are meaningless if people don't really believe them".
However, Radcliffe said the changes were "heavy handed" and "confusing to the public".
Swann, who took 104 wickets in 79 one-day internationals, was referring to the 2015 World Cup when Eoin Morgan's team were humbled by a group-stage exit, in which they only won games against minnows Scotland and Afghanistan.
Since then, England have won series against World Cup runners-up New Zealand, Pakistan (twice), Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indies and now Ireland. They only lost to Australia and South Africa by the odd game in five.
They hammered Ireland despite the absence of key men Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, who are playing in the Indian Premier League.
Swann added: "They have such a strong middle order. Especially when you consider they can bring in Jos Buttler - one of the best in the world - and add him to that middle order and then Ben Stokes, who is arguably the best player in the world in all formats.
"Eoin Morgan and (head coach) Trevor Bayliss ripped up that piece of paper from 2015 and said 'that's nonsense', we'll get the right personnel in, fill them with confidence, back them to the hilt and ask them to try and post 400 when they bat.
"They scored 328 against Ireland and the captain said he felt they were 40 runs short. That's amazing to hear. Not too long ago, England captains and teams of old would have been cock-a-hoop with a score of 328."
His side can move seven points clear with three games left if they beat Middlesbrough on Monday (20:00 BST).
"I think Tottenham have an advantage, if you compare Tottenham to Chelsea," said the Italian.
"This is my first season and I found a lot of situations, a lot of players. Mauricio Pochettino has been working there for three years and has changed a lot of players and is working very well.
"For me, Tottenham are a really strong team and it's normal to see them fighting for the title."
Conte believes Spurs, who were Leicester City's main challengers in 2015-16 before fading to finish third, would have easily won the Premier League this season if it were not for his side's impressive season.
"In this season, if Chelsea had not performed in this way, Tottenham would win the title without difficulty," he said.
"Only this great season from us is pushing them to fight and, maybe, to win or not to win the title."
The former Juventus and Italy boss could lead his side to a league and FA Cup double, 10 months after Chelsea finished 10th, with an FA Cup final against Arsenal on 27 May.
Unlike some of their rivals, Chelsea have not been involved in Europe and Conte thinks it is difficult for English clubs to succeed in the Champions League because of the strength of the Premier League.
In the past six years, five English clubs have reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League, compared to 17 from Spain and 10 in Germany.
Conte said: "This league is very difficult. Every single game you must fight a lot and, I think, also for this reason it's not easy to arrive at the end of a European competition.
"It is so clear here, every season will be tougher and tougher to qualify for the Champions League."
422 quick 100 metres Kipchoge ran each mile at an average pace of around four minutes and 36 seconds. To achieve a sub-two clocking, the Olympic champion would have effectively had to run 17 seconds for 100 metres 422 times in a row.
He lapped 27-year-old Desisa, who finished in 2:14.10, while Tadese, 35, came home in 2:06.51. Kipchoge always looked the stronger and was on target pace with around seven miles to go but he began grimacing in the closing stages and though he tried to sprint up the home straight, his fatigue was obvious.
Pacemakers applauded and encouraged him as he approached the line and the clocking comfortably outstrips his recognised personal best of 2:03.05, set at the London Marathon in 2016.
"I'm happy to have run two hours for the marathon," added Kipchoge. "My mind was fully on the two hours but the last kilometre was behind the schedule. This journey has been good - it has been seven months of dedication." Women's world-record holder Paula Radcliffe called Kipchoge's run "truly inspiring".
Only a select few media were allowed in to witness the attempt at the race circuit near Milan and Kipchoge's time was initially reported to be a second quicker until Nike confirmed the 2:00.25 clocking.
The brand paid the three runners to forgo the London and Berlin Marathons this year prompting some criticism of the event given the resources invested and the fact it will not count as a legitimate record.
Nike's big corporate rival, Adidas, is planning its own sub two-hour marathon attempt but wants to do so in a race setting.
Analysis
BBC athletics commentator Ed Harry
Eliud Kipchoge is, I believe, the greatest physical specimen ever to line up on a marathon start line. If he can't run sub-two, then I don't see another athlete that will do it any time soon.
Kipchoge ran close to the legitimate world record in London in 2016, and perhaps would have broken it in Berlin the year before if his shoes that day hadn't lost their insoles.
He's made history of sorts in Monza, and he's right to be proud of pushing the boundaries. What he needs to do now is break the world record on an IAAF-recognised course.
He has the talent to do that and the world record is all that's missing from a phenomenal career.
Adam Gemili says Britain's sprint strength means just getting in the team would make him a strong medal contender at August's World Championships.
Gemili, 23, finished fourth in the 200m at Rio 2016, just three thousandths of a second away from a bronze medal.
However Jamaica-based duo Zharnel Hughes and Miguel Francis are among fierce competition for the two spots on offer at July's British team trials.
"Making that team - you'll know you are among the world's best," said Gemili.
"It is going to be really difficult. The depth is great and everyone is going to have to be in good shape for the trials because nothing is given."
Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake, the second-fastest Briton of all time over 200m after a run of 19.95 seconds in May 2016, Olympic semi-finalist Danny Talbot and promising 21-year-old Reece Prescod are some of the other contenders for a place in the British team.rancis had previously run for Antigua and Barbuda, but opted to switch to Britain in April. The 22-year-old is eligible for Britain as he was born in Montserrat, an Overseas Territory without its own Olympic team.
"For me it was slightly strange," said Gemili of Francis' decision.
Silvan Dillier pipped Jasper Stuyven to victory as Luxembourg's Bob Jungels retained the overall lead after stage six of the Giro d'Italia.
Swiss BMC rider Dillier and Belgium's Stuyven, of Trek-Segafredo, were part of a five-man group that broke away on the 217km ride to Terme Luigiane.
Dillier just had enough to edge his rival in a punchy uphill finish.
Team Sky's Geraint Thomas stayed second overall - six seconds behind Jungels - with fellow Briton Adam Yates third.
Orica-Scott rider Yates is 10 seconds behind Quick-Step's Jungels, on the same time as favourites Nairo Quintana and Vincenzo Nibali, who also finished safely in the main bunch on Thursday.
Friday's stage is a 224km ride from Castrovillari to Alberobello that features one fourth-category climb.
Welshman Thomas said: "The break going clear meant it was a bit less stressful, although it was still pretty stressful - there might have been splits so everyone wanted to be at the front.
"I felt pretty good. It's just a case of getting through these stages. It's always a bit weird on stages like today and yesterday - you're not completely switched on like you might be on a big day. But the legs seem to be OK."

"I don't really know his personal reasons for changing, but if anything it is more difficult to make the team in Britain than it is in Antigua.
"It is cool. It makes it more competitive. I'm excited to meet him and get to know him. He will be a great addition to the British sprinters."Gemili switched from coach Steve Fudge to the Netherlands-based training group led by American Rana Reider after last year's Olympics.
The rivalry between the two training camps became unfriendly in 2014, with reports of physical and verbal confrontations, but Gemili insists Britain's top sprinters get on better now.
"Everyone is close and gets on and when someone runs fast, you are genuinely happy that people are being successful. It make you raise your own performance and run even faster," he added.
As well as competition from his compatriots, Gemili hopes the power of his own mind will help him find the fractions of the second necessary to win his first major championships medal at senior level.
The morning after finishing fourth in Rio, Gemili spoke to psychiatrist Dr Steve Peters, who is famed for his work with the likes of Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins and snooker great Ronnie O'Sullivan.
Gemili recalled: "He really hit me with it.
Team Sky's Geraint Thomas remains in contention after day two of the Giro d'Italia, finishing in the chasing pack behind stage winner Andre Greipel.
Germany's Greipel (Lotto Soudal) proved fastest from a bunch sprint to claim victory in the second stage of the 100th edition of the Giro and take possession of the leader's pink jersey.
He picked up bonus seconds to overtake overnight leader Lukas Postlberger.
Welshman Thomas is 11th overall heading into Sunday's third stage of 21.
He is 14 seconds behind Greipel.
"It was a frantic finale again," Thomas told BBC Sport after the 221km stage from Olbia to Tortoli in Sardinia. "The last 50km flew by with the descent and then the crazy last 10km on the flat.

Geraint Thomas predicts stage three of the Giro d'Italia will be tough
"The boys looked after me really well, same as yesterday. I went into that last corner in the top 10 or 15 and just stayed in that position all the way to the line.
"I think it will be quite a tough stage on Sunday. The forecast is for 40km/h winds so it could be a short, fast and intense day."
It was Greipel's seventh overall stage success in the Giro, which ends in Milan on 28 May.
"It was not an easy day, six hours on the bike. I owe it to my team-mates, who worked hard all day," said Greipel, who is leading a Grand Tour for the first time in his career.
Stage three sees a flat 148km route from Tortoli to the Sardinian capital of Cagliari.

Germany's Andre Greipel (Lotto Soudal), who had won the previous stage and held the overall lead, finished in 10th.
The racers had to contend with strong crosswinds throughout the third and final stage on Sardinia.
Gaviria and his team-mates caused a split in the peloton with 10km to race, and powered over the line in triumph at the end of the 148km ride from Tortoli to Cagliari.
All of the main contenders for leader's pink jersey are well placed in the standings before Monday's rest day and Tuesday's ascent of Mount Etna.

Spanish authorities must pay ex-cyclist Roberto Heras 725,000 euros (?612,592) after the country's Supreme Court rejected their appeal against his overturned positive doping test.
Heras, 43, tested positive for the banned substance erythropoietin (EPO) at the 2005 Tour of Spain and was suspended for two years by Spain's Royal Cycling Federation.
The findings were overturned in 2011 and Heras sued the Spanish state in 2013 for 1 million euros but the compensation has been reduced.
The Supreme Court said in a statement it rejected the Spanish state's appeal because the overturned sanction was the direct cause of Heras losing commercial and professional contracts.
Heras' positive test was overturned in 2011 by a civil court in Castile and Leon, which ruled that irregularities had taken place in the analysis of blood samples in the investigation.
The Supreme Court upheld that decision in 2012 and ordered Heras - a former US Postal team-mate of Lance Armstrong - be reinstated as the 2005 Tour of Spain winner.
Armstrong, who retired from cycling in 2005 but then returned to the sport between 2009 and 2012, was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and given a lifetime ban by United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) in 2012.
Colombian Fernando Gaviria (Quick-Step) won stage three and took the leader's jersey in a dramatic third day of the Giro d'Italia.
Team Sky's Geraint Thomas remains in contention in 11th place overall, 23 seconds behind the leader.

WASHINGTON (AP) President Donald Trump on Thursday granted a rare posthumous pardon to boxings first black heavyweight champion, clearing Jack Johnsons name more than 100 years after what many see as his racially-charged conviction.
Its my honor to do it. Its about time, Trump said during an Oval Office ceremony, where he was joined by boxer Lennox Lewis and actor Sylvester Stallone, who has drawn awareness to Johnsons cause.
Trump said Johnson had served 10 months in prison for what many view as a racially-motivated injustice and described his decision as an effort to correct a wrong in our history.
He represented something that was both very beautiful and very terrible at the same time, Trump said.
Johnson was convicted in 1913 by an all-white jury for violating the Mann Act, which made it illegal to transport women across state lines for immoral purposes, for traveling with his white girlfriend.
Trump had said previously that Stallone had brought Johnsons story to his attention in a phone call.
His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial, Trump tweeted in April. Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon!
Johnson is a legendary figure in boxing and crossed over into popular culture decades ago with biographies, dramas and documentaries following the civil rights era.
He died in 1946. His great-great niece has pressed Trump for a posthumous pardon, and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., have been pushing Johnsons case for years.
The son of former slaves, Johnson defeated Tommy Burns for the heavyweight title in 1908 at a time when blacks and whites rarely entered the same ring. He then mowed down a series of great white hopes, culminating in 1910 with the undefeated former champion, James J. Jeffries.
McCain previously told The Associated Press that Johnson was a boxing legend and pioneer whose career and reputation were ruined by a racially charged conviction more than a century ago.
Johnsons imprisonment forced him into the shadows of bigotry and prejudice, and continues to stand as a stain on our national honor, McCain has said.
Posthumous pardons are rare, but not unprecedented. President Bill Clinton pardoned Henry O. Flipper, the first African-American officer to lead the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry Regiment during the Civil War, and Bush pardoned Charles Winters, an American volunteer in the Arab-Israeli War convicted of violating the U.S. Neutrality Acts in 1949.
Linda E. Haywood, the great-great niece, wanted Barack Obama, the nations first black president, to pardon Johnson, but Justice Department policy says processing posthumous pardon petitions is grounded in the belief that the time of the officials involved in the clemency process is better spent on the pardon and commutation requests of living persons.
The Justice Department makes decisions on potential pardons through an application process and typically makes recommendations to the president. The general DOJ policy is to not accept applications for posthumous pardons for federal convictions, according to the departments website. But Trump has shown a willingness to work around the DOJ process in the past.
Wenger's side face Southampton in the Premier League on Wednesday and a win would lift them into fifth.
The Frenchman, whose contract expires at the end of this season, has been criticised by some fans this term.
Lauren, 40, told BBC Africa: "He knows how to deal with pressure, hopefully things will be in the right way sooner or later."
Lauren played 159 league games for Arsenal between 2000 and 2007 and was part of the "invincibles" side that won the 2003-2004 league title.
The former Cameroon right-back said: "I don't think he will resign. He's been under pressure for 30-35 years, managing big clubs with big pressure."
In February Wenger said he would decide on a new contract in March or April, but later said that he made a mistake in giving that timeframe. Ajegunle is known for being one of Lagos' toughest, most dangerous slums, but it also has another reputation - for producing some of Nigeria's top footballers. So what's the secret to its unlikely success? BBC Africa's Stanley Kwenda has been finding out.
For a football-obsessed nation like Nigeria, talent can be found in every corner, but there's definitely something special about Ajegunle, or AJ City, as it's known by locals.
Since the early 1990s, Ajegunle has been churning out football talent. Famous names such as Taribo West, Odion Ighalo, Brown Ideye, Samson Siasia, Obafemi Martins, Taribo West and Jonathan Akpoborie all started here.
Life is not easy for many of the residents of this sprawling ghetto.
They have to contend with high crime rates, as well the absence of running water, grid-powered electricity or healthcare.
So what are the factors that contribute to Ajegunley's footballing pedigree? Diversity, for one.
"It's a community with so many people from different ethnicities," says Bennedict Ehenemba, a football scout for German clubs who is a native of Ajegunle.
"Ajegunle accommodates the Yorubas, the Igbos, the Hausas, the Itsekiris and all the other tribes in Nigeria.
"It's a raw talent hub of Nigeria," he tells me.

British Superbike champion Shane Byrne says he broke all of his ribs, his neck and four vertebrae after crashing during testing in Norfolk last week.
Byrne had surgery on Monday following a crash at Snetterton on 17 May.
Posting on social media, the Be Wiser Ducati rider, 41, said paralysis had been a "major issue and concern".
"The one at question from my surgeon after seeing my X-rays was how on earth are you not paralysed," the Englishman added.
After the crash, Byrne's team posted on social media that he would have surgery and "make a full recovery".
Superbike Championship organisers said he was briefly unconscious on the track after the crash at Turn 3.
"I have two bruised lungs, all of my ribs fractured, four broken vertebrae, a broken neck in two places, broken septum, collarbone, multiple other back fractures," Byrne said on Saturday.
"[The] operation to fix the back and neck ran obvious risks of paralysis potentially coming back in the mix.
"Fortunately the op went very well. I'm now pretty sore and beaten up but a rehab and recovery programme always starts the instant a crash ends.
"It's a long road ahead but for once I got a great start."
Six-time champion Byrne is the most successful rider in British Superbike Championship history, with no other competitor having won more than three titles.
After three rounds of the 2018 championship, two-time defending champion Byrne is third in the overall standings after winning one race at Brands Hatch in April.
The 2018 Superbike Championship continues at Snetterton in June.
Many success stories can be traced back to two local institutions - St Mary's Catholic Church and the Navy Barracks Camp.
They remain safe places for many young people to play the game.
Other open spaces are often claimed by so-called "Area Boys", unruly gangs who often demand a fee for people to play there.
Super Eagles striker Jonathan Akpoborie, who made his name in Germany's Bundesliga in the 1990s, also honed his skills here.
"This is actually the home of football in Nigeria," Akpoborie tells me, adding that the game is seen by many youngsters as a route to a better life.
"I don't want to downgrade the area by attributing the success of footballers to poverty but there's just nothing to do for the kids.
"They spend most of their time here playing football and in so doing they develop themselves and naturally become gifted footballers.
"In one national team there's always one player who originated from Ajegunle.
"It's exactly how I started - the grown-ups play first, we watch them play, then eventually we get in the field. They were inspirational to us."

The slum also has an established system of grassroots football, which encourages talented youngsters to play competitive football for local clubs at an early age.
This often gives them an edge over players at competing academies across the country.
Alfred Emuejeraye, who plies his trade in the Swiss lower leagues, also grew up in Ajegunle.
He believes the secret of the slum lies in its deep love of the game.
"The people here, the community are passionate about football, passionate about everything and are driven to succeed in whatever they do from musicians to taxi drivers... It's an all-round community," he tells me.
Odion Ighalo - formerly of Watford FC in the English Premier League but now playing for Chinese Super League outfit Changchun Yatai FC - is another Ajegunle native.
Now he lives in some of the world's biggest cities, but still remembers Ajegunle fondly.
"It was very tough growing up there. It's not like in Europe where you have everything provided.
"You have to look for money to buy football shoes, jerseys, transport and even water for to drink after training. If you can't afford the transport then you stay - and those who stay are great players," says Ighalo.

Bolarinwa Olajide is a sports reporter with Lagos-based radio station Wazobia. He saw many of these players emerge from Ajegunle over the years.
"We see the hopeless, those who know they have a talent but they can't exhibit it anywhere. They can't afford fees to join a football academy, so they go to Ajegunle because they know scouts come to watch them play, and it's a chance to show what they can do as footballers," he tells me.
Leicester City and Nigeria midfielder Wilfred Ndidi did not grow up in Ajegunle but played against boys from the slum during his time at an academy in Lagos.
He believes Ajegunle has produced good football players because the boys there "work hard, the lifestyle is difficult so they try to work very hard and come out with their best."
To keep the Ajegunle legacy going, some of the footballers are already giving back to the community with projects to nurture future talent.
Akpoborie is helping to identify future football talent, while Ighalo is building an orphanage in the heart of the slum. Former South Africa captain Benni McCarthy says he nearly walked off the pitch because of the incessant racism during matches when he played in Europe.
The striker began his European career with in 1997 at Dutch club Ajax.
He went onto play for clubs in Spain, Portugal and England during his career.
"At times I didn't want to even play anymore because I couldn't take it, people calling you all kinds of things," he said.

Former South Africa captain Benni McCarthy admits he nearly walked off the pitch when he was subjected to racist abuse during his career in Europe.
"It's not my fault my skin is darker than others. I was born this way."
McCarthy said he learnt to deal with it over time despite the distress it caused him.
"It used to give me more energy when people are so ignorant and racist, they make you play better, they make you want to beat their team so bad," he added.
Twenty years after McCarthy arrived in Europe, the issue of racism is still in the headlines.
On Sunday, Pescara and Ghana midfielder Sulley Muntari walked off the pitch after he complained of racist abuse during a match against Cagliari.
Muntari was banned for a match after he was booked for dissent after asking the referee to stop the match claiming he was being racially abused.
The 32-year-old ex-Ghana international then walked off the pitch in protest - for which he received a second yellow card, officials have now confirmed.
I was very surprised that in England you don't hear monkey chants from opposition fans,
Former South Africa striker Benni McCarthy
Cagliari were not punished by the authorities in Italy for the abuse saying not enough fans took part in the abuse to trigger action.
McCarthy said his worst period was when he played for Celta Vigo and Ajax Amsterdam.
"You find the whole stadium making monkey noises and throw bananas," said McCarthy as he reflected on his playing days in Europe," he explained.
"For me colour is just a reflection, we are all human beings, we are the same.
""In Portugal when you play for your club, they love you but when you play outside your club, it's different, you suffer, you face racism."
Things were however different for him in England, where he played for Blackburn and West Ham United.
"Of my journey, England was probably the most respectful. I was very surprised that in England you don't hear monkey chants from opposition fans," the 39-year-old continued.
"They swear and throw personal insults, call you useless but racism - no.
"I applaud the the Premier League for having such a strong regime and football clubs for making sure that their fans are respectful to ethnic African minority players." Lucas Alcaraz has been outlining his vision as Algeria coach at his first public appearance since being named.
The Spaniard was appointed last Thursday just three days after being sacked by Granada.
He has signed a two-year contract with the Algeria Football Federation (FAF) and is expected to reach the last four of the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
"We haven't come here to impose our way of doing things. We want to integrate our ideas," he told reporters.
2018 World Cup qualifying after 2 matches:	2019 Afcon qualifying group:
Nigeria 6 pts	Algeria
Cameroon 2 pts	Benin
Zambia 1 pt	The Gambia
Algeria 1 pt	Togo
The 50-year-old becomes Algeria's fourth full-time coach in the last 13 months and dismissed talk about his lack of international experience.
"Before coaching in La Liga I didn't have any experience either. I have never run a national team but I'm not scared," he said.
"Every nation's football has its own qualities. We are are going to bring our ideas while we learn about Algerian football.
"I am not hard, I am not soft, I am rigorous, I give and I demand.
"I am going to analyse the needs of the team before I chose the player.
"Our duty is to see all Algerian players wherever they come from. Our choice will be made according to their form."
His appointment came as a surprise to many in Algeria since another Spaniard Joaquin Caparros had been expected to be given the job.
Alcaraz however insisted he had not been in touch with the Algerian federation while at Granada.
"I was not contacted before I was fired as Granada coach but only afterwards," he said.
"I then met with (Kherridine) Zetchi (president of FAF) and I was surprised that he knew anything about me."
He replaces Belgian Georges Leekens who quit after Algeria were eliminated from the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations at the group stage.
Christian Gourcuff resigned as coach in April 2016 to be replaced by Milovan Rajevac who quit after just two games.
Algeria are aiming to reach a third straight World Cup but are bottom of their qualifying group with a single point from two matches.
They are five points behind leaders Nigeria and their next games are home and away against Zambia, who also have one point.
Only the winners of Group B will play the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
"As for the World Cup the situation is complicated but we will fight in every match," he said.
Alcaraz's first competitive match in charge will be against visiting Togo in June when Algeria begin their qualifying campaign for the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations.
Benin and The Gambia are the other two teams in Group D, with only the pool winners guaranteed a place at the finals in Cameroon. Sierra Leone football looks set for a new start after years of problems and infighting within its governing body.
An extraordinary congress in Freetown on Thursday ended with Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) president Isha Johansen and her biggest critics embracing and shaking hands to pave the way for a fresh beginning for football in the country.
One of the major reasons for the tension between aggrieved stakeholders and the SLFA executive committee was the setting up of an appropriate body to investigate match-fixing allegations.
It's a good day. Football is bigger than us. What I want is a genuine and lasting peace
Isha Johansen
President of Sierra Leone's Football Association
This has now been resolved with the formation of an ethics body - a first for Sierra Leone football.
It will be one of the association's judicial bodies and will investigate four Sierra Leone internationals, referees and administrators accused of match-fixing by the SLFA.
The convening of the first congress under the current SLFA administration came about after Sierra Leone's president Ernest Bai Koroma gave the SLFA an ultimatum to solve their internal dispute on or before March 31, 2017.
It was also in line with a peace road map set out by Fifa secretary general Fatma Samoura (pictured below) when she visited Freetown last November.
"I'm extremely happy. It's the start of a good working relationship between us and the stakeholders," said Johansen.
"It's a good day. Football is bigger than us. What I want is a genuine and lasting peace."
The extraordinary general assembly also paved the way for nine out of 14 Premier League teams to put an end to a breakaway league to participate in the country's top tier league which will commence soon.
Fifa's secretary general Fatma Samoura visited Freetown in November.
At the end of the congress Johansen said: "I'm pleased to announce that we are ready to play football everywhere in Sierra Leone at all levels."
She also stated that the SLFA would provide almost $29,000 for the commencement of the Premier League and it would also provide financial supports to other domestic competitions including the female national league.
Leader of the stakeholders, Idrissa Tarawalley, who doubles as secretary general of a Premier League club Ports Authority FC, is delighted about the truce and the decision for the Premier league to start soon.
"We are happy that there is now peace as a result of a successful extraordinary congress. This is what we've been yearning for. We only hope that it'll be a sincere and lasting peace," said Tarawalley.
"We look forward to further discussions with the FA on how to move things forward.
"I'm also delighted that the beneficiaries - the footballers - will now have a chance to ply their trade as we have agreed that the Premier League will start soon.
"For far too long we've deprived our footballers from playing. We can no longer afford to deprive them" Tarawalley added.
The Sierra Leone Sports minister Ahmed Khanou, who co-chaired the congress as moral guarantor of the peace process, is also buoyed by the mood of optimism.
"I'm happy about the outcome of the congress and be assured that I'm committed to getting lasting peace, " said Khanou.
"The consultations will continue and I'm happy everybody is now on board to play football everywhere in the country." The new president of Algeria's football federation, Kheireddine Zetchi, wants to get the national team back on track and develop the local game.
Zetchi was elected unopposed on Monday after incumbent, Mohamed Raouraoua, refused to stand for a third consecutive term.
Algeria failed to get out of their group at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations in Gabon.
"There are priorities, namely the appointment of a coach," Zetchi said.
He has set a deadline of two weeks to find a new coach to replace Belgian George Leekens, who resigned in January after the Nations Cup failure.
Zetchi's other aims for the Algeria Football Federation:
Install CCTV cameras in every stadium to improve crowd safety	Broadcast amateur matches
Revamp the commission for match officials	Ensure more diversity within the federation
"I cannot mention names, but we do have CVs that we will study with the members of the federal bureau," he continued.
"We will opt for the candidate who corresponds to our brand of football - we all agree that Algerian football is centred on short passes and dribbling."
Zetchi, who is also the president of second division champions Paradou Athletic, wants to develop the game in Algeria as well.
Two of his main aims are to reform the committee that deals with financial fair play (DNCG) and set up four regional academies across the country.
"Our most important project is the rehabilitation of Algerian football and that means reforming amateur football," he continued.
"The role of the DNCG is not to punish, it is to help clubs balance their budget.
"If, from next season, we prohibit clubs from operating in deficit or debt, that will be a significant step towards financial fair play."
His predecessor Raouraoua had asked all local clubs to invest in academies, Zetchi has admitted that such a goal may be unrealistic.
"The outgoing president has left financial means for the federation and this must be spent to football development, which means the building of academies," Zetchi explained.
"We will invite clubs to invest alongside us until clubs can build their own academies and be autonomous."
Zetchi's club will play in the Algerian top-flight next season after two successive promotions with a team made-up of young players while the youth sides have also enjoyed success at a national level.
He set up Paradou in 1994 after making his money in ceramics and then founded Algeria's first academy in 2007.
The project is run by Jean-Marc Guillou Academies, who previously worked with Asec Mimosas in Ivory Coast, which produced the likes of the Toure brothers and Salomon Kalou.
Zetchi's appointment brings to an end 12 years in charge for Raouraoua, during which time he was was credited with reviving Algerian football in the international arena.
During his tenure, Algeria qualified for two World Cup finals and five Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.
The former Caf Executive Committee member will also be remembered for petitioning Fifa in 2009 to change its statutes to allow players switch international allegiance even after the age of 21.
Despite these successes critics have accused Raouraoua of neglecting local football at the expense of the national team.
Zetchi looks like he has his work cut out for him both locally and internationally with Algeria at the bottom of their 2018 World Cup qualifying group with a single point from their two matches so far. Rob Paternostro: Leicester Riders boss wins BBL coach of year award

Rob Paternostro has been with Riders since 2008
Leicester Riders head coach Rob Paternostro has been named BBL coach of the year for the fourth time.
The American, who first won the accolade in 2009, retains the award he won last season, after guiding Leicester to a second successive BBL title as well as BBL Trophy success.
Riders could yet seal a treble, with a BBL play-off semi-final against London Lions to play on Friday and Sunday.
"This really is about the unselfishness of the team," Paternostro said.
"Right from day one, that has been the key for us in what is always a very tough and competitive BBL season from top to bottom.
"And we still have some work lying in front of us," he added.

O'Neal says he wants to bring people closer together
US basketball legend Shaquille O'Neal has announced his plans to run for sheriff in 2020, but he has not yet decided where.
The former NBA star, known as Shaq, owns homes in both Georgia and Florida and could run in either state.
"This is not about politics. This is about bringing people closer together," O'Neal told an Atlanta news outlet.
He is an honorary deputy in Clayton County in Georgia and has served as a reserve police officer in Florida.

"When I was coming up, people loved and respected the police, the deputies, and I want to be the one to bring that back, especially in the community that I serve," the former Lakers star told NBC affiliate WXIA.
The Hall of Famer said his ability to relate to everyone makes him perfect for the role.
"I can put on a suit and have a conversation with Bill Gates. I can go in the hood and talk to the homies, and talk to the children," he said.
His imposing 7ft 1in (2.16m) bulk would surely also come in useful as a deterrent to would-be law-breakers.
"My style is going to be to surround myself with guys that have been doing it way longer than I've been doing it, surround myself with smarter people. And I know it will be successful."
O'Neal is also a deputy marshal in Lafayette, Louisiana, according to Southern Living. BBL & WBBL: Leicester, Newcastle, Nottingham & Sevenoaks seek play-off titles

Leicester Riders will be aiming for a domestic treble when the showpiece final games of the British Basketball League and Women's British Basketball League take place on Sunday.
Having won the BBL Championship and BBL Trophy, Riders face a Newcastle side aiming for a double of their own following their BBL Cup success.
In the WBBL, Sevenoaks Suns are seeking a second trophy of the season.
They face formidable foes in league winners Nottingham Wildcats.
Riders ready to roll
Riders boss Rob Paternostro, the coach of the year, told BBC Sport his side are well prepared for facing the might of the Eagles.
"It's a long season and when you get to this stage with all the big games we have played you have to be conscious that the guys could be a little fatigued," he said.
"As the season ended we wanted to make sure we got everyone healthy and ready for the last run. When we walk out on at the 02 Arena in front of 17,000 people, the guys will be ready to go.
"It should be exciting; this week in training you can see the guys are fired up and ready to roll."
Paternostro added: "Newcastle is a team that have had unparalleled success in the BBL over the last 10 years. We have played them many times in final games and understand what they bring.
"They have great players, are well coached and play hard and that's great to play against because it raises the level of your team.
"When you are standing courtside and coaching and look out and think 'this is a heck of a basketball game' and we expect similar on Sunday."
Fab Flournoy guided Newcastle to a third successive BBL Cup success
'Both dominant teams'
Eagles player-coach Fab Flournoy, 43, has been playing for the north-east side since 2001 and is hoping to secure a seventh play-off title.
"Beating Leicester won't prove we're the dominant team, and Leicester beating Newcastle won't prove they're the dominant team. Both teams are dominant teams because that is what they are," he told BBC Radio Newcastle.
"They're going to be wanting to close it off with the triple and we're going to be wanting to close it off with the double.
"It's not trying to take anything from someone; it's just that they're in our way and we're in their way."

Plymouth Raiders said Johnny White had coached at the "highest level" in his native Australia but Basketball Australia said he was not a registered coach
A man was appointed the head coach of a major British basketball team without his professional credentials being checked, it has emerged.
Australian Johnny White was appointed by Plymouth Raiders following the recommendation of one of their players.
The club also received an unsolicited letter of support from a former club. He has since left Raiders.
Raiders owner Bob Widdecombe, a former chairman at Crimestoppers, admitted they did not make any further checks.
'Not a registered coach'
Mr White was appointed in July last year with the club stating on its website he had a lot of experience coaching "at a high level in Australia".
The website statement mentioned he had spent five seasons as an assistant coach in the Australian top division with the Melbourne Tigers.
However, after being approached by the BBC, Raiders admitted this was not the case and removed the statement from their website but insisted he had been a coach at the Melbourne Tigers in 2016.
But Basketball Australia told the BBC he was not a registered coach during that year and Nigel Purchase, Melbourne Tigers' general manager, said Mr White fulfilled "advisory and scouting roles" at the club but would not say whether he was a paid employee.
Mr White left Plymouth Raiders shortly after the BBC contacted the club.

A statement in the Plymouth Raiders website citing Mr White's experience at Melbourne Tigers was taken down after questions were asked by the BBC
To get a UK visa Mr White must have been either a head coach or assistant coach in the past two seasons in a senior professional league.
The Home Office would not say if it would investigate, stating they do not comment on individual cases.
A Plymouth Raiders statement said: "Our background checks on Mr White included a letter from the Chief Executive of the Melbourne Tigers, clearly stating that he was employed in an assistant coach role with the club last summer."
The club said it had "stuck rigidly" to the criteria laid down by Basketball England in order to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement, which is required to get a visa.

July 2016: White made head coach.
March 2017: Raiders reach BBL trophy final, heavily beaten.

He added: "Johnny White was not a registered coach with Melbourne Tigers."

In 2009 the IOC decided to add women's boxing to the list of Olympic sports for the London Games in 2012.
Boxing had been the only sport reserved for men at the games. Debates raged about this decision.
Should boxing be an Olympic sport for anyone, especially women? Was it progress? Was this creating a new sport at the expense of some existing sports?
Mostly the debate centred on whether women should engage in a sport, the main purpose of which is to inflict damage on your opponent and, in the professional game, possibility to knock the other person unconscious.
Many people think that this is a new Olympic sport for women and know little if anything about the fact that women's boxing has a history that stretches back to the 18th century in many parts of the world.
Having said that, "prize fighting" would be a more accurate description of the activity which often took place at fairgrounds and in exhibition halls in Europe in the 18th and 19th centuries.
MC Marykom
MC Marykom has been nicknamed "Magnificent Mary"
When boxing became one of the Olympic sports at the third modern Olympics in St Louis in 1904, women's boxing was a displayed event; a brief moment in the 20th century Games.
Its invisibility during much of the 20th century doesn't mean that women weren't boxing.
They may not have been on television, or taking part in professional fights with big prize money but the sport was being practised.
The history of women's boxing is somewhat different from that of many other sports, which may account for some of the controversies which have surrounded it. Women's boxing can be seen to have started in England in the 1720s in the form of prize fighting.
In the 19th century women's boxing was prohibited in many US states and in Europe; it was banned in Britain in 1880, not very long after Queensberry rules had been implemented, in 1865.
Up until the mid-20th century there were, however, exhibitions and bouts on both sides of the Atlantic with popular fighters like "Battling" Barbara Buttrick, who actually did have a fight screened on television in 1954.
Legal battle
During the 1970s several US states allowed women to box, permitted new licences and approved bouts with more than four rounds and in 1993 women's amateur boxing was integrated into the rules of the US amateur programme.
It was not, however, until 1996 in the US that women's professional boxing was formally accepted and the Christy Martin bout with Deirdre Gogarty marked the birth of modern professional women's boxing in the US.
It was another two years before Jane Couch won her legal battle on grounds of sex discrimination with the British Board of Control in the UK.

There are three types of women's boxing - amateur, professional and unlicensed.
At the end of the 20th century, the International Amateur Boxing Association accepted new rules for women's boxing and approved the first European Cup for Women in 1999 and the first World Championships for women in 2001.
Boxing remains controversial, both for women and for men, and new regulations have been brought in to make the sport safer, although boxing is far from the top of the tables of risk of severe injury.
According to an Australian survey in 1998 reported by AIBA (see link on right), boxing came 10th in a league table of sporting injuries with rugby league well ahead, followed by sports such as rugby union, motor cycling, cricket and soccer.
'Disciplined regime'
Amateur boxing is a long way from prize fighting. In the 21st century, there is considerable interest in the sport at all levels.
Boxing is a highly regulated sport which many women enjoy as a means of keeping fit, as a disciplined regime through which you can gain self-esteem and feel good about your body.
It's a competitive sport in which you can not only achieve a personal best but also gain pride in representing your country and engaging in global sport, for example at the Olympics.
It's a tough sport, but women have fought for the right to join in and in 2012 they can at the Olympics too.
Young women, like four times world amateur boxing champion, minimum weight boxer, MC Marycom of India, are looking forward to demonstrating their skill.

Lomachenko stops Linares in 10th, wins lightweight title

NEW YORK (AP) Vasiliy Lomachenko stopped Jorge Linares in the 10th round of their lightweight championship fight Saturday night, winning a title in his third weight class in just his 12th pro bout.
Lomachenko landed a hard left to the body during a flurry of precision punches that sent Linares went to a knee. Linares finally got up just as the count was reaching 10 but referee Ricky Gonzalez called an end to the fight at 2:08 of the round.
Linares knocked down Lomachenko in the sixth and the fight was all even after nine rounds before Lomachenko (11-1, 9 KOs) put an overpowering end to his first fight at 135 pounds, adding that title to his belts at 126 and 130 pounds.
Linares (44-4, 27 KOs) hadnt lost since 2012 and used his size advantage to do some damage, but in the end Lomachenko did more in an exciting Madison Square Garden match.
The fighter widely known as Vasyl said this week he prefers to use Vasiliy, his legal name. And now he can be called lightweight champion after picking up the WBAs version of the belt in front of a crowd of 10,429 that chanted Loma! Loma! and waved blue and gold flags for much of the night.
It was Lomachenkos eighth straight victory by stoppage, but this one was much tougher than a recent stretch of clinics in which his last four fights ended when his opponents corners wouldnt let them take more punishment from the Ukrainian.
Lomachenko had joked he should be called no mas Chenko for his habit of making opponents quit, but Linares made him earn this victory.
The Venezuelan was on a 13-fight winning streak and was giving the two-time Olympic gold medalist the test he wanted, one that he said would bring out the best in what many already consider the most skilled fighter in the world.
Each fighter was ahead 86-84 on a judges card, while Julie Lederman had it 85-all after nine rounds.
Lomachenko said Thursday he needed to finally be put in danger to show his complete array of skills, 
and then on display in the 10th round with a series of shots that Linares couldnt defend, especially the left to his midsection that took the biggest toll.
Great Britain men secured promotion back to ice hockey's elite level for the first time since 1994 with an overtime win over Hungary in Budapest.
Robert Farmer equalised with 15 seconds of regulation time remaining to give GB the point they needed from the World Championship Division 1A game.
Hosts Hungary had led 2-0 in the third period before Robert Dowd's goal set up a frantic finish.
"What we have achieved is out of this world," said captain Jonathan Phillips.
"We believed we could do it and that was so key.
"We had belief in ourselves from the moment we arrived and the confidence just built throughout the week."
GB are the first team to win back-to-back gold medals in Division 1.
After a 2-2 draw in regulation time, they won 3-2 after a shootout as overtime ended with the score still level.
Winning promotion is the best feeling ever says GB goalkeeper Ben Bowns
The two points for an overtime win meant GB - who had been in the third tier and ranked 29th in recent years - topped their group with 11 points.
Peter Russell's team will now play in the 2019 World Championships alongside some of the world's best teams such as Canada, Russia, USA and Sweden.
"This team is very special and what we have pulled off is absolutely unbelievable," said Russell. "We did not give up and showed true British spirit to pull that one out of the bag."
Great Britain ice hockey team celebrate beating Hungary
Great Britain ended the tournament with four wins (one in overtime) and one defeat
Netminder Ben Bowns, who made a series of vital saves - including a penalty-shot stop when the score was 2-1, told BBC Sport: "There's going to be a lot of shots next year! It's going to be fun, I can't wait.
"We generated momentum, got a scrappy goal that was exactly what we needed and the guys kept going and we got the equaliser."
Captain Phillips added: "We set our goal and we didn't give up and showed the character to come back from a terrible first period when I think the nerves set in."

Analysis
Seth Bennett, BBC ice hockey commentator
With 10 minutes to go, Great Britain looked dead on their feet, but somehow, from somewhere, they found the energy to fight back.
Dowd changed the mood of the building and then, after Bowns had saved a penalty shot, GB had one last chance.
Farmer made something from nothing and that was enough to seal gold and fairytale end to the tournament.
There is no underestimating the importance of this day for British ice hockey - so often looked at as being the poor relation of the rest of Europe.
This week has shown that, despite no external funding, they are ready to play with the sport's elite. Russell has guided this group of players and they have given him every last drop of energy.
As to how they will cope with playing against the world's best teams, only time will tell, but after a generation of players missed out on the chance to play at the top level, this group of have earned their place in the history books.
Five games in seven days and Great Britain delivered a tournament that will go down as one of the most incredible in their World Championship history.

CARSON, Calif. (AP) Gennady Golovkin won his 20th consecutive middleweight title defense with a second-round knockout of Vanes Martirosyan on Saturday night.
Golovkin (38-0-1, 34 KOs) tied Bernard Hopkins record for middleweight title defenses by sending Martirosyan down at 1:53 of the second round.
After being tagged with a strong three-punch combination from Martirosyan (36-4-1) late in the first round, Golovkin responded with a devastating charge in the second. He started the onslaught with a short left and pounced on the damaged Martirosyan, finally dropping him with two powerful lefts.
The fight was arranged at the last minute after Golovkins rematch with Canelo Alavarez fell apart. Golovkin and Alvarez fought to a draw last September and were set to meet again in Las Vegas on Cinco de Mayo before Alvarez was suspended for six months by the Nevada Athletic Commission in April after failing a March drug test.
With the lucrative fight against Alvarez scuttled until this fall at the earliest, Golovkin was eventually able to put together a replacement bout in Southern California, where he built up a strong following with a series of title defenses at StubHub Center and the Forum. Despite short notice and a modest card, promotors expected Golovkin to draw a record-crowd for boxing at StubHub Center of more than 9,000.
Golovkin said he would take on all comers, including Alvarez.
I want everyone, Golovkin said. I have a lot of belts. I challenge anyone to come and take my belts. I dont care who. Lets clean out the division.
In the first womens fight on HBO in the cable networks 45-year history of broadcasting boxing, undisputed welterweight champion Cecilia Braekhus (33-0) remained undefeated with a unanimous decision win over Kali Reis (13-7-1).
Braekhus won 97-92, 96-93 and 96-93 on the three scorecards despite being knocked down to one knee by a hard right from Reis in the seventh round. Reis nearly dropped Braekhus again in the eighth with another hard right, and the crowd booed when the result was announced after Reis late charge.
UFC featherweight champion Cris Cyborg attended the fight and confirmed her interest in boxing against Braekhus.

LOS ANGELES (AP) Canelo Alvarez has withdrawn from next months middleweight title fight with Gennady Golovkin, two months after Alvarez twice tested for a banned substance.
The May 5 fight in Las Vegas was to have been a rematch of the draw they fought last September. But on March 5, Alvarezs promoters, Golden Boy Promotions, announced he twice tested positive for the steroid clenbuterol in February. They blamed contaminated meat, and Alvarez agreed to random drug testing.
It was unlikely the Nevada State Athletic Commission would approve the fight after it temporarily suspended Alvarez, who could face a longer suspension.
Alvarez is to appear before the commission April 18 concerning the positive tests. Golden Boy President Eric Gomez said Tuesday the promoters were advised Alvarez likely would not be cleared to fight May 5.
I have always been a clean fighter and I always will be a clean fighter, Alvarez said Tuesday during a conference call. I want to prove without a doubt that I have never intentionally ingested clenbuterol. I have nothing to hide and I want to be open and transparent through this process. . I have never taken illegal substances and this is no different.
Golovkin is hoping to fight a different opponent at T-Mobile Arena on May 5, but it wont approach the huge event that the rematch with Alvarez would have been. Its possible the two could meet later this year, depending on any sanctions placed on the Mexican fighter.
Golovkin, of Kazakhstan, publicly doubted that tainted meat caused Alvarezs positive test.
Again with Mexican meat? Come on, Golovkin said in March. I told you, its not Mexican meat. This is Canelo. This is his team. This is his promotion.  Canelo is cheating. Theyre using these drugs, and everybody is just trying to pretend its not happening.
NEW YORK (AP) Vasiliy Lomachenko stopped Jorge Linares in the 10th round of their lightweight championship fight Saturday night, winning a title in his third weight class in just his 12th pro bout.
Lomachenko landed a hard left to the body during a flurry of precision punches that sent Linares went to a knee. Linares finally got up just as the count was reaching 10 but referee Ricky Gonzalez called an end to the fight at 2:08 of the round.
Linares knocked down Lomachenko in the sixth and the fight was all even after nine rounds before Lomachenko (11-1, 9 KOs) put an overpowering end to his first fight at 135 pounds, adding that title to his belts at 126 and 130 pounds.
Linares (44-4, 27 KOs) hadnt lost since 2012 and used his size advantage to do some damage, but in the end Lomachenko did more in an exciting Madison Square Garden match.
The fighter widely known as Vasyl said this week he prefers to use Vasiliy, his legal name. And now he can be called lightweight champion after picking up the WBAs version of the belt in front of a crowd of 10,429 that chanted Loma! Loma! and waved blue and gold flags for much of the night.
It was Lomachenkos eighth straight victory by stoppage, but this one was much tougher than a recent stretch of clinics in which his last four fights ended when his opponents corners wouldnt let them take more punishment from the Ukrainian.
Lomachenko had joked he should be called no mas Chenko for his habit of making opponents quit, but Linares made him earn this victory.
The Venezuelan was on a 13-fight winning streak and was giving the two-time Olympic gold medalist the test he wanted, one that he said would bring out the best in what many already consider the most skilled fighter in the world.
Each fighter was ahead 86-84 on a judges card, while Julie Lederman had it 85-all after nine rounds.
Lomachenko said Thursday he needed to finally be put in danger to show his complete array of skills, and then on display in the 10th round with a series of shots that Linares couldnt defend, especially the left to his midsection that took the biggest toll.

MIAMI (AP) Jake LaMotta, the former middleweight champion whose life was depicted in the film Raging Bull, has died at the age of 95.
His fiancee, Denise Baker, says LaMotta died Tuesday at a Miami-area hospital from complications of pneumonia.
The Bronx Bull, as he was known in his fighting days, compiled an 83-19-4 record with 30 knockouts.
LaMotta fought Sugar Ray Robinson six times, handing Robinson his first defeat. He lost the middleweight title to him in what became known as the St. Valentines Day Massacre.
In his previous fight, LaMotta saved the championship in movie-script fashion against Laurent Dauthuille. Trailing badly, LaMotta knocked out the challenger with 13 seconds left.
LaMotta threw a fight against Billy Fox, which he admitted in testimony before a U.S. Senate committee. He said he was promised a shot at a title.
On June 16, 1949, he became middleweight champion when Marcel Cerdan couldnt continue after the 10th round.
The 1980 film Raging Bull was based on LaMottas memoir. Actor Robert DeNiro won an Academy Award for it.
