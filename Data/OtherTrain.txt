<s> britains national gallery sent its collection of masterpieces into a welsh slate mine during world war two writes holly williams </s>
<s> hide them in caves and cellars but not one picture shall leave this island </s>
<s> so declared winston churchill in 1940 determined that the national gallerys collection should be saved from nazi attacks  but also that the masterpieces should remain on home turf </s>
<s> the elgin marbles were hidden in aldwych tube station  later revealed to have been unable to sustain a direct hit  or should that be under it </s>
<s> for the national gallery did in fact keep its paintings safe by storing them underground in an old slate mine in manod north wales </s>
<s> keeping masterpieces in a mine doesnt sound like a great plan  but the paintings were actually very happy down there says minna mooreede a curator of the recent national gallery exhibition titled manod the nations treasure caves about this unique period of the museums history </s>
<s> the small show featured archive imagery of the paintings being relocated to the mine near blaenau ffestiniog in snowdonia as well as photographs of it today taken by robin friend </s>
<s> during world war two much of the art was destroyed in fighting or looted never to be seen again </s>
<s> and although a lot was also saved thanks to the heroic efforts of individuals and institutions some of the stories of art in wartime do make you wince for the poor works </s>
<s> in london the elgin marbles were hidden in aldwych tube station  although alarmingly it was later revealed it wouldnt have withstood a direct hit </s>
<s> in paris the louvre was emptied out in 1939 with 3600 paintings packed off to safe houses </s>
<s> the mona lisa  now considered too fragile to be moved  was shuttled round the country five times moving from chateau to abbey to chateau to keep her one step ahead of the nazis </s>
<s> in britain the national gallery wasnt the only institution to relocate to wales   the british museum sent the magna carta works by michelangelo raphael and leonardo da vinci and rare books including shakespeare and milton to the national library of wales in aberystwyth </s>
<s> even this wasnt deemed safe enough however and during the war they dug an underground cave with a special heating system in which to store the works </s>
<s> the axiss attic  but the determination to squirrel art away for after the war was just as strong among the nazis </s>
<s> hitler had grand plans to turn his childhood hometown of linz into a super museum containing all the worlds greatest art </s>
<s> nazi theft in order to fulfil this hideously overblown ambition was therefore huge and systematic </s>
<s> but the works had to go somewhere during the fighting  and many went into a salt mine in altaussee austria </s>
<s> over 6500 paintings were stored there including works by michelangelo rubens vermeer and rembrandt as well as the ghent altarpiece </s>
<s> that they ever made it out is almost miraculous instructions had been given for the whole lot to be blown up in the event of german surrender </s>
<s> it is believed the plan was thwarted by local miners and a nazi official who swapped vast bombs waiting to send the whole collection skyhigh for smaller ones that when detonated only brought down enough rubble to block the entrance </s>
<s> the work remained safe underground until the monuments men  an allied taskforce charged with finding and saving europes art  got to them after the war ended </s>
<s> still for all that sticking grand masters in a salt mine might sound sacrilegious at least it was dark and cool  not actually the worst conditions for the paintings </s>
<s> and one of the things that is fascinating about the history of manod is that the relocation of 1800 paintings to wales ultimately ushered in a significant new era of conservation for the institution </s>
<s> explosives were used to enlarge the entrance of the mine so the biggest works could fit in and a railway system inside the caves was developed to move the paintings around </s>
<s> six brick store houses were built inside the cavernous space allowing them to control temperature and humidity </s>
<s> this labyrinthine subterranean world became thronged with art but also life many local men were employed to help look after the paintings </s>
<s> they were sleeping down there </s>
<s> for four years that was their job and it would have been bustling with people says mooreede </s>
<s> the national gallerys chief curator at the time martin davies moved into a nearby cottage  and apparently thrived in the remote spot </s>
<s> the gallerys exile offered him a chance to spend time in close proximity to the collection and he took full advantage of it completing major new catalogues of the permanent collection </s>
<s> he did a lot of research because the paintings were so accessible explains mooreede </s>
<s> he was a shy quiet man who really relished the opportunity to have no public around </s>
<s>   museum matériel  this was also a crucial period for the gallerys developing understanding of how best to store paintings </s>
<s> in the 1940s the national gallery actually didnt have any kind of airconditioning system </s>
<s> having to move to manod meant a lot of thinking and research about how best to house the collection and a team was able to closely monitor the paintings in controlled conditions </s>
<s> there was a small studio built outside the quarry where they did a lot of conservation work it was actually a very formative time for the gallery says mooreede </s>
<s> after the war major renovations were needed anyway following bomb damage to the gallery and so air conditioning was added and a new scientific department established </s>
<s> manod nearly never happened however the initial proposal had been to ship everything to canada </s>
<s> kenneth clark the gallerys director was nervous about the possibility of uboat attacks and the notion was scotched altogether when he spoke to churchill about it </s>
<s> possibly the prime minister had one eye on the patriotic potential of british art in wartime </s>
<s> manod was obviously kept secret somewhat alarmingly the mine was maintained as a clandestine evacuation site in case of nuclear war until 1983 </s>
<s> but churchills hunch that somehow it was important to keep the collection on home turf also proved quite correct </s>
<s> in the last couple years of the war the national gallery took to exhibiting a single picture of the month in london brought out of storage in manod </s>
<s> the aim was to buck up beleaguered british spirits and it became a sensation  up to 30000 visitors a month flocked to get a glimpse of just one painting with popular choices including velázquezs the rokeby venus and titians noli me tangere </s>
<s> kenneth clarke chose what came back very carefully they wanted pictures that had deep emotions  he was aware the public was in need of sustenance suggests mooreede </s>
<s> while the photographs of manod today reveal only the ghost of the gallery in the caves  the odd empty frame or piece of railway track  in london the national gallery was forever changed by what went on during the war according to mooreede </s>
<s> even in showing only one painting a month this national institution connected more widely and powerfully with its public than ever before as the saying goes you dont know what youve got till its gone </s>
<s> well until its temporarily hidden in a welsh slate mine at any rate </s>
<s> popular history has it that the word sabotage from the french sabot or wooden shoe was first used in the early 20th century to describe the labour strike strategy of throwing ones clogs into machinery to stop up production </s>
<s> sometimes art has the effect of moral licensing  instilling in its viewer a false sense of having accomplished something  but the word in fact derives from the act of stomping disruptively during official speeches </s>
<s> both origin stories factor into the words current use  these are strategies for obstructing systems of power whether they are economic flows political events or military operations </s>
<s> this year the new museum in new york opened its fourth triennial titled songs for sabotage with works by 30odd artists and collectives from 19 countries that the shows curators claim set out to reveal the built systems that construct our reality images and truths with a call for action an active engagement and an interference in political and social structures </s>
<s> but rather than the documentary images organisational meetings and workshops one might expect from such a promise the show was heavy with paintings and sculptures </s>
<s> presumably these works of visual art are in fact the songs of the exhibitions title </s>
<s> of course propaganda allegories and calls to action are not themselves action and art that represents change or resistance does not necessarily affect change or resistance </s>
<s>  saddams disney for a despot   the art hidden from nazi bombs   dazzling art from a degenerate dynasty  this brings up a problem that often arises in conversations about art how can it participate in networks of power that its content willfully rejects </s>
<s> often socalled political art simply aestheticises protest or resistance </s>
<s> sometimes it has the effect of moral licensing  instilling in its viewer a false sense of having accomplished something </s>
<s> art and power have always been begrudging bedfellows </s>
<s> after all karl marx and friedrich engels wrote the communist manifesto from the comfort of la maison du cygne a gilded restaurant in brussels </s>
<s> lets consider a brief history of sabotage in the art world  in what ways have artists reckoned with the idea that the most powerful acts of creation might be those of destruction </s>
<s> and moreover if it is possible for artworks themselves to actually interfere in political and social structures what does that disruption look like </s>
<s> of course sabotage isnt simply about breaking things </s>
<s> sabotage is breaking things so that something else something different can happen </s>
<s> appetite for destruction  in terms of destroying art itself one might think of gustave courbets successful proposal in 1871 to topple and disassemble the vendôme column during the events of the paris commune a monument he claimed was devoid of all artistic value tending to perpetuate by its expression the ideas of war and conquest of the past imperial dynasty </s>
<s> or more recently of british artist hannah blacks conversationfueling but unsuccessful 2017 open letter requesting that dana schutzs painting open casket which reproduced the famous image of emmett till at his funeral be removed from the whitney biennial and destroyed </s>
<s> both of these cases however are gestures of framing </s>
<s> the proposals to topple the column and ruin the painting are not artworks in themselves </s>
<s> by contrast in 1995 the chinese artist ai weiwei did indeed make an artwork dropping a han dynasty urn by destroying another artwork </s>
<s> his performance is represented in three blackandwhite photos the artist holds the 2000yearoldceremonial vase it is caught in midair it shatters on the floor </s>
<s> by smashing the urn weiwei ruins the monetary value of the ancient object but also its cultural value </s>
<s> and on a symbolic level the action represents a rejection of the legacies of the han dynasty 206 bce220 ce a defining period in chinese history </s>
<s> in this way he provokes the viewer to consider who determines cultural and monetary values alike </s>
<s> but this all plays out only on the level of representation no political or social system is impeded </s>
<s> efforts of art world sabotage are often directed instead at the institutions that support art reflecting artists frustrations with issues of visibility and accessibility </s>
<s> we might trace this to the 1863 salon des refusés when courbet édouard manet james mcneill whistler and others rejected from the paris salon displayed their work under the auspices of emperor napoleon iii in another venue at the palace of industry </s>
<s> a century later in 1969 daniel buren was excluded from the famous exhibition when attitudes become form in bern and in response he covered the citys billboards with his stripes effectively inserting himself into the show </s>

<s> credit getty images gustav metzger created his autodestructive art by spraying hydrochloric acid on sheets of nylon then standing by as they dissolved over 20 minutes credit getty images strategies of withdrawal and refusal have likewise been a mode of art world sabotage </s>
<s> in 1969 the art workers coalition formed with such artists as lucy lippard and carl andre at the helm organising antiwar protests and urging major institutions to close in opposition to the vietnam war </s>
<s> their actions were in dialogue with other artistled organisations at the time such as women students and artists for black art liberation directed by faith ringgold and the ad hoc women artists group led by lippard whose protests resulted in the inclusion of black women artists in the following whitney biennial </s>
<s> in 1974 german artist gustav metzger attacked the commodification of art through such artworks as the years without art  19771980 which called for a threeyear hiatus on all art production discourse and sales though his recruitment process was illfated </s>
<s> bug in the system  still other sabotagelike methods galvanise viewers to take action </s>
<s> in a 1968 performance argentine artist graciela carnevale gathered participants in a glassfronted gallery in rosario argentina before leaving and locking the door behind her </s>

<s> her action challenged the very efficacy of art to affect reality </s>
<s> another mode of sabotage is to pass off found elements from real life as art though these efforts have historically been panned by critics  as when the 1993 whitney biennial included plumber george hollidays home video of los angeles police officers beating rodney king or when curator artur zmijewski invited occupy wall street protesters simply to take over an entire floor of the seventh berlin biennale in 2012 </s>
<s> credit graciela carnevalespai visor graciela carnevale locked attendees at a glassfronted gallery as an experiment to see how long before theyd turn to violence credit graciela carnevalespai visor these projects sabotage the very concept of what an artwork can and should be </s>
<s> but to return to the opening question what artworks actually do serve to interfere with political and social structures </s>
<s> hardpressed i can think of only a handful that supersede the fraught dynamics of art life and power to intervene in systems while maintaining rigor in form or concept  works of art that actually do have purpose and effect on the real world </s>
<s> in 1997 the german artist christoph schlingensief pulled off one such work when he organised tötet helmut kohl </s>
<s> kill helmut kohl </s>

<s> schlingensief and abu hamdan alike disrupted a status quo to force a change </s>
<s> of course sabotage is mischievous </s>
<s> often it is an intervention that begins as a minor interference that multiplies or magnifies to result in the destruction of a system </s>
<s> and often it is perpetrated anonymously </s>
<s> this relationship to duration and authorlessness alone makes true sabotage an irksome task for artists </s>
<s> that said my favourite act of artistic sabotage was perpetrated in 1981 in the quiet of the night by czech artist ivan kafka </s>

<s> the reputations of other western artists are no match to that of picassos in this part of the world </s>

<s> the bold colours the cubist portraits of deconstructed faces and chaotic pictorial compositions appear to resonate very little with the traditional asian notion of beauty </s>

<s> the brand name effect of picasso could be the art markets answer to birkin bags and according to wong the versatility of picassos creations from paintings to sculptures and ceramics offers buyers a range of choices </s>
<s> but money aside says wong the colourful life of picasso strikes a chord with how the chinese romanticise the life of a great artist </s>
<s> born in 1881 picasso was known for not only constantly reinventing his artistic expressions in different periods but also his romantic affairs with women </s>
<s> he had four children with three women including olga khokhlova and françoise gilot who were his wives and marietherese walter </s>
<s> his love affair with photographer and artist dora maar was also well documented </s>
<s> picassos carefree lifestyle resonates with that of famous ancient chinese scholars such as ming painter and poet tang yin 14701524 who was renowned for his poetry and ink paintings and was married to three women </s>
<s> modern chinese artist zhang daqian 18991983 who met picasso in nice in 1956 also displayed a similar persona </s>
<s> equally prodigious and prolific zhang was one of the biggest names in chinese modern art </s>
<s> not only did he inherit the roots of traditional chinese landscape paintings and invent new artistic language in his bold splashink paintings and portraits of women he was also known for his affairs with many women and had four wives </s>
<s> but beyond the romantic details of his biography the aesthetics of picassos paintings are what appeal to the chinese  much more so than other big names of western art such as claude monet and vincent van gogh </s>
<s> wong says picassos portraits speak to modern china as portraits have played an important role in modern and contemporary chinese art particularly since 1949 </s>
<s> mainland chinese artists were trained to follow the soviet school of social realism where portraits play a key role in the works of chinese artists from chen yifei to zhang xiaogang </s>
<s> chinese people over the past century are accustomed to the appreciation of portraits he says </s>
<s> but thats not the only factor says wong </s>
<s> chinese people who grew up with the multipleperspective style in traditional landscape paintings would find it easier to connect with picassos cubist portraits </s>
<s> in their research into multiperspective images scott vallance and paul calder of the school of informatics and engineering at flinders university of south australia noted the similarities between chinese landscape paintings and cubism chinese landscape paintings contain different focuses or subimages which are seamlessly joined </s>
<s> while multiperspective has been deep in chinese aesthetics for centuries its introduction to the western art world through movements such as cubism led by picasso came much later </s>
<s> its not surprising if picasso was under certain asian influences at some point </s>
<s> his encounter with asian art was probably earlier than his highly publicised meeting with zhang </s>
<s> masayuki tanaka professor of art history at musashino art university in tokyo japan says picasso revealed his connection with asian art to japanese painter taro okamoto when the latter visited the spanish artists studio in vallauris in the early 1950s </s>
<s> okamoto was under a great deal of influence from picasso and one of his most famous works myth of tomorrow is his response to picassos guernica with both being artistic representations of the horrors of war </s>
<s> picasso told okamoto that he possessed several japanese woodblock prints and that they were not refined ones but earlier more primitive ones he says </s>
<s> to picasso primitive does not mean something uncultured but rather it is the other way of representation than the traditional western style based on perception and accurate realistic description </s>
<s> asian tradition of representation is different from the western style and it is not perceptional but more conceptual </s>
<s> in that sense picassos way of expressing something is familiar with asian people </s>
<s> you can still find the same way of expression in manga today as picasso did </s>
<s> an asian sensation  while chinese peoples love for picasso is a more recent phenomenon picassos rendezvous with japan appears to date back much earlier </s>
<s> prof tanaka says books on picasso were first published in japan in the 1920s and one of the first western art exhibitions after world war two was a picasso show in 1951 </s>

<s> and to imagine what will come </s>
<s> tricks of the light  the times are changing and that would seem to present a challenge to apichatpong whose features to date have evolved discernibly without ever wholly transforming </s>

<s> but is it an issue for apichatpong himself </s>
<s> soon he will start shooting for the first time outside thailand  in colombia  with a cast that includes for the first time an international star tilda swinton </s>

<s> youve been watching too many gangster movies qiao zhao tao tells bin liao fan in ash is purest white </s>
<s> but you can bet that hes never watched any like the one hes in himself </s>
<s> written and directed by jia zhangke this sprawling epic is undeniably a gangster movie but it is also something stranger and sadder a haunting transcendent and often downright weird meditation on transience loyalty and the soul of modern china </s>
<s> qiao is a gangsters moll </s>
<s> she claims that she isnt part of her boyfriends jianghu underworld brotherhood and that her priority is her elderly father who lives in a crumbling coalmining town nearby </s>
<s> but with a sharp bobbed haircut and cool confidence that recall uma thurman in pulp fiction qiao is more than capable of taking care of business greeting each of the brothers with a playful punch whenever she drops in on their mahjong den and making sure that debts are paid and transgressions punished </s>
<s> few filmmakers are as observant or as poetic as jia is about the passing of time  her boyfriend is the broadshouldered squarejawed bin the trusted lieutenant of the areas biggest property developer and club owner </s>
<s> but a new generation of hoodlums is snapping at his heels </s>

<s> she then swears to the police that the gun is hers so bin gets out of jail after a year and she has to stay in for five </s>
<s> but neither he nor any of his fellow gangsters rewards her loyalty </s>
<s> he is nowhere to be seen when she has served her sentence so she ventures down the yangtze river to find him determined that they should be reunited </s>
<s> ash is purest white delivers its share of gangstermovie thrills </s>
<s> jia builds the tension mercilessly when bin and qiaos car is surrounded by thugs on motorbikes and then releases that tension with a brutal martial arts dustup </s>
<s> later when qiao goes in search of bin the film becomes a funny feminist revenge caper </s>
<s> refusing to be defeated she proves herself rousingly adept at conning stealing and threatening her way around a remote town equipped with nothing but her wits and a plastic water bottle </s>
<s> but these generic pleasures are just one part of a long digressive odyssey which ranges from 2001 to 2018 </s>
<s> often shot in pale natural light ash is purest white comes to feel like a mythical tale of a spirit wandering the afterlife or an astronaut lost on an alien planet  and thats even before qiao bumps into a man who says that his travel agency specialises in ufospotting tours </s>
<s> a mangy lion and tiger make an appearance and there are several ballroom linedancing and disco interludes the village peoples ymca crops up again and again just as the pet shop boys go west featured in jias last film mountains may depart </s>

<s> people age relationships wane crime syndicates fade and china itself mutates as cities are redeveloped and the three gorges dam puts miles of countryside underwater </s>
<s> few filmmakers are as observant or as poetic as jia is about the passing of time building sites and smartphone technology are particular obsessions </s>
<s> and zhao  jias wife  responds miraculously to the acting challenge transforming herself in subtle ways so that qiao becomes harder yet more exhausted as the years grind by </s>
<s> towards the end of the film though you may feel as if youve aged almost as much as qiao has i certainly wouldnt have minded if it had been half an hour shorter </s>

<s> there is it seems no stopping the socalled meghan effect  the phenomenon where every item of clothing meghan markle wears immediately sells out </s>

<s> meanwhile traffic to the website of jewellery brand birks increased 400 per cent and even a simple black jumper from marks and spencer sold out twice after markle wore it for a public engagement </s>
<s> and this is even before any sign of the brides choice of wedding dress already sparking febrile speculation in fashion circles and needless to say sure to lead to new bridal trends </s>
<s> the phenomenon of royal women influencing fashion is nothing new of course </s>
<s> look no further than the kate effect still being wrought by the duchess of cambridge not to mention the diana effect in the 1980s and 90s </s>
<s> but what is perhaps less known is quite how influential the personal styles of certain royal women were  long before the invention of the internet or any mass media for that matter </s>
<s> so what does it take to be a royal style icon </s>
<s> and how different  or not  was it then from now </s>
<s> the level of scrutiny today is in a different realm elly summers tells bbc culture </s>
<s> summers is curator of an exhibition at the museum of fashion in bath royal women which looks at how various royal women helped shape popular fashion tastes with their own personal styles </s>
<s> it seems alexandra was just the kind of royal woman the public were craving  back in 1863 princess alexandra born into the danish royal family married queen victorias eldest son prince albert edward otherwise known as bertie </s>
<s> until then bertie had been notorious for his string of affairs and was known as a playboy prince yet the marriage proved a great success and the couple were hugely popular </s>
<s> it seems alexandra was just the kind of royal woman the public were craving </s>
<s> queen victoria had been in mourning dress for years and was quite removed from british society explains summers she wore a black austere uniform and she didnt attend parties </s>
<s> edward and alexandra on the other hand were a dazzling couple who had an active social life and were seen as more accessible </s>
<s> it was good for the royal family to reconnect with the public again having been so remote </s>
<s> and as it turned out the popular alexandra also became a huge influencer of fashion </s>
<s> she was a fashion icon and people would copy what she was wearing says summers </s>
<s> she forged her own look she was very involved in crafting her image and she was a trend setter even if it wasnt necessarily on purpose </s>
<s>   not that the danish princess was allowed complete sartorial freedom and independence </s>
<s> her future motherinlaw queen victoria was insistent that alexandra wear british lace for her wedding rather than the belgian creation that the princess had been offered by the king of belgium </s>
<s> the queen was adamant that she was becoming british and it was important to display that says summers </s>
<s> it was a new identity and she was told to align her identity with britishness </s>
<s> as a result the wedding dress princess alexandra wore was lavishly decorated with britishmade honiton bobbin lace making a strong statement that she was putting her new country first </s>
<s> there was orange blossom adorning the gown and it was worn with a voluminous veil </s>
<s> the design of the fabric included delicate roses shamrocks and thistles the traditional symbols of england ireland and scotland </s>
<s> alexandra did however insist on one alteration the reduction in the width of the originally vast crinoline skirt </s>
<s> also just a few days after the wedding the dress was on her unsentimental insistence whisked away in order to be completely remade pared down and simplified </s>
<s> alexandra favoured simple designs says summers </s>
<s> she had a different more practical sensibility </s>
<s> she was from a branch of the danish royals that was not wealthy didnt live in luxury and her wedding trousseau was small </s>
<s> alexandra was the first woman in british public life to favour tailored looks for daytime which had previously only been associated with riding coats and other sportswear </s>
<s> a cream wool doublebreasted yachting jacket by vernon and a smartlycut waistcoat by bussbein are two examples in the exhibition of what was then a daring new look </s>
<s> as summers points out tailored suiting for womens daywear is now a successful formula but previously had been only in the male domain </s>
<s> perfect princess </s>
<s> in the 20th century royal women continued to influence fashion </s>
<s> as the sister of the queen the late princess margaret had complex and often contradictory expectations put upon her </s>
<s> she had more freedom to express her own taste and as a result was considered more of a fashion icon than the monarch </s>
<s> as a young woman margaret was a favourite with the press because of her glamorous fashionable image yet she was also intensely scrutinised and her love life often made headlines </s>
<s> during the postwar years her socialite reputation and the shenanigans of the bohemian margaret set were a source of great interest to many </s>
<s> and her recent portrayal in tv series the crown has brought her sense of style  and occasionally maverick ways  to a new audience </s>
<s> princess margarets glamorous sensibility was clear early on </s>
<s> she was just 17 when in 1947 she met christian dior who had come to london to the savoy to show his iconic groundbreaking new look collection </s>
<s> margaret and her mother queen elizabeth the queen mother were both keen to see the collection and so after the fashion show the dresses were secretly smuggled out of the savoy and taken to the french embassy where the two royal women had a private viewing </s>
<s> christian dior described princess margaret as a real fairy princess delicate graceful exquisite </s>
<s> certainly she cut a stunning figure in the delicate dior creamsilk dress that she wore to royal ascot in 1952 </s>
<s> with its chiffon boned bodice skirt and asymmetrical bolero it was exquisite and delicate </s>
<s> paired with elegant elbowlength black gloves and a widebrimmed creamandblack hat the outfit rendered margaret a model of princessy perfection </s>
<s> a year later the blackandpink lace evening dress by norman hartnell that margaret wore to a performance of guys and dolls was another stunning gown </s>
<s> it was just a few weeks after the news of her unsuitable romance with the group captain peter townsend had broken in the press </s>
<s> the dress was an unapologetically glamorous choice suggesting a certain grandeur and defiance in the face of criticism </s>
<s> margaret had something of a reputation for haughtiness but she also had her moments of appropriateness and diplomacy </s>
<s> when she wore a redandwhite cotton evening dress it was an unusual unostentatious choice of fabric for eveningwear </s>
<s> it was in fact a nod to the british textiles industry in times of postwar austerity </s>
<s> as a member of the royal family there was always an underlying expectation to promote british industry </s>
<s> so how do 21stcentury expectations of royal women differ from the past </s>
<s> there are still key considerations in every ensemble and royal women still need to balance all factors says summers </s>
<s> now i think it is similar but more intensified and more immediate </s>
<s> people have always wanted to have the dresses worn by royalty but before for instance with princess alexandra women in court asked their dress makers to make them something similar then ladies in aristocratic circles copied them and then it filtered down to the general public </s>
<s> now its more immediate it is straight to the high street </s>
<s> in some respects it was easier in the 19th century and early 20th century as it was not a media age says summers </s>
<s> you just dressed for a particular event  now you have to dress for everyone all the time </s>
<s> but still now royal women wouldnt go to a ball informally dressed she adds </s>
<s> people always want to see the royal women dressed in beautiful clothes theyd be disappointed if they werent </s>
<s> royal women public life personal style is at the fashion museum bath until 28 april 2019 </s>
<s> from singer solange knowles in her backless lowcut jumpsuit to poppy delevignes bohofloral number what constitutes bridal wear has gradually morphed over recent decades </s>
<s> of course the white or ivory wedding dress popularised by queen victoria has certainly endured and theres no denying its totemic power </s>
<s> for many brides it encapsulates a hopeful romantic nostalgia </s>
<s> it can have a transformative effect says senior curator at the victoria and albert museum edwina ehrman who has studied how wedding dresses have changed in tune with fashion and society over the centuries </s>
<s> and if youve already been living with your partner or even if youve had children you may want to wear white at your wedding because you feel it marks a new phase in your relationship </s>
<s> so quintessentially bridal has the white dress become that now when a bride chooses to tie the knot wearing another colour its still considered daring and rebellious think singer gwen stefani in a dramatic dipdyed number by john galliano or actresses anne hathaway jessica biel and reese witherspoon all of whom wed in  pink </s>
<s> and when designers oscar de la renta vera wang and temperley bridal debuted nonwhite weddingdress collections it was initially viewed as a radical move in the conservative bridalwear industry </s>
<s> yet getting married in pink purple yellow red the typical bridal gown colour in china or any other colour for that matter is nothing new in western culture nor particularly irreverent says ehrman </s>
<s> over the centuries brides who were interested in fashion have often got married in different colours </s>
<s> and they would wear them many times afterwards altering them over the years to fit in with fashion or to fit a changing figure </s>
<s> and it was common for women not to buy a new dress for the occasion but to simply get married in their best existing outfit </s>
<s> bridal fashion adapted to wartime as best it could </s>
<s> people did what they could during world war ii explains ehrman </s>
<s> they would borrow a dress or wear their service uniform </s>
<s> women in the armed forces could also hire a dress and some brides made dresses out of curtain fabric </s>
<s> we have an example in the show of a buttercupprint dress made of lightweight upholstery fabric </s>
<s> the most memorable wedding outfits for me are those that define an era from a fashion perspective  jenny packham  postwar the midcalf ballerinalength design became popular favoured by women who had careers </s>
<s> there were some spectacular oneoff gowns too </s>
<s> margaret whigam one of the first it girls wore a big showy gown by norman hartnell </s>
<s> she was beautiful rich and she loved the camera  she was the perfect client for hartnell says ehrman </s>
<s> that was not a garment that could be altered for another occasion </s>
<s> in the swinging 60s singer lulu sported a white hooded furtrimmed maxi coat over a mini dress and high boots </s>
<s> the thea porterdesigned empireline dress displayed in a previous va weddingdress exhibition  demure but flirty as ehrman puts it  in devore velvet is quintessentially 1970s </s>
<s> the reason the white wedding dress has survived is because it can evolve and remain fashionable it persists because it can be reinvented </s>
<s> designer jenny packham agrees </s>
<s> the most memorable wedding outfits for me are those that define an era from a fashion perspective she says </s>
<s> bianca jagger in that white suit audrey hepburn in a mini dress and head scarf </s>
<s> packham designs bridal wear as well as eveningwear and is a favourite with many highprofile women including the duchess of cambridge </s>
<s> some are ditching the white wedding dress to make a point about gender politics  so what era influences packhams bridal wear the most </s>
<s> the 1930s are always a great source of inspiration  a wonderfully decadent and glamorous era between the wars it was a design explosion of divine proportions </s>
<s> and how does she predict the wedding dress will evolve </s>
<s> the bridal dress must stand out as a piece of clothing at the moment there is a comfortable standoff between the red carpet and the aisle </s>
<s> neither wants to look like the other </s>
<s> alice temperley is influenced by the silhouettes and spirit of the 1920s </s>
<s> why has the romantic ultrafeminine gown endured for so long in her view </s>
<s> the wedding dress is traditional timeless and defies trends she says recalling her own wedding dress made with antique lace and 1920s sequins that i had collected since childhood </s>
<s> its all in the detail agrees gareth pugh who has created stage outfits for the likes of lady gaga and kylie minogue  and whose dramaticbutromantic bridal dress for stylist katie shillingford is part of the va collection </s>
<s> a costume for the stage and a wedding dress both have very specific roles to fulfil pugh tells bbc culture </s>
<s> however the approach and process are very different </s>
<s> with a wedding dress there are layers of subtlety that you can achieve that you just cant replicate on stage  usually because a wedding dress is viewed in much closer quarters </s>
<s> and a bride is more willing to forego comfort </s>
<s> and how does pugh think the wedding dress will evolve in the future </s>
<s> i think the idea of dressing up and presenting a side of oneself that is a fantasy will always appeal he says </s>
<s> for most a wedding is perhaps the one day where they are allowed free rein to really go to town </s>
<s> there will always be a niche market for the traditional white meringue but i like the idea of the dress being a little more personal  something that is made with love and care something that takes time and patience  a lot like the marriage itself </s>
<s> and new customs and dress codes are being introduced constantly </s>
<s> as edwina ehrman puts it gay weddings and crosscultural weddings are both examples of how new traditions are being established </s>
<s> all of which feeds into the multibilliondollar global weddingattire industry </s>
<s> there is definitely a spirit of competitiveness around weddings now  the bridezilla or groomzilla phenomenon is real says ehrman </s>
<s> and the alternativewedding bridezilla who wishes to make a conscious statement through her wedding can be just as competitive  in fact some are ditching the white wedding dress to make a point about gender politics </s>
<s> thats nonsensical says ehrman </s>
<s> if you want to wear a coloured dress on your wedding day or trousers or go barefoot go ahead </s>
<s> but the idea that wearing a white wedding dress is going to somehow enslave you is absurd  equality and respect are what matter in a marriage not what you wear at your wedding </s>

<s> meghan markle is a 36yearold california native a denizen of hollywood a former actress in a popular tv drama </s>
<s> she is also whip smart bighearted and as ferociously contemporary as supermodel adwoa aboah on the cover of vogue </s>
<s> in choosing markle to be his wife harry has arguably pulled the monarchy into the 21st century </s>
<s> ever since the engagement was announced in november the couple have forged new paths inviting youth charity workers and community leaders to the wedding instead of political leaders asking for donations to small charities instead of gifts </s>

<s> from the capsleeved empire lined gown topped with a satin bow to outrageously generous tulle ball skirts the aesthetic would have chimed perfectly with meghans refined but modernist taste </s>
<s> but even the bride of harry has constraints </s>
<s> as an american marrying into the british royal family a british label would be the most diplomatic choice  points out gowanseglinton </s>
<s> obviously meghan has had to adapt </s>
<s> flick through images of markle pre and postengagement and even the most indifferent observer will note that shapes have become more sculptural hemlines longer and hats are in </s>

<s> last summer i was stuck </s>
<s> i had just started working on a proposal for a new book and despite commencing countless drafts of potential opening paragraphs in a word processing document nothing seemed to click </s>
<s> i would type my thoughts read them rub my head then highlight and delete everything i had written repeating the process over and over again with no end in sight </s>
<s> after two fruitless hours of this punctuated lets be honest with a lot of social media surfing i shut the laptop and walked away but not before grabbing a pen and a few scraps of paper </s>
<s> i went for a short walk found a nice shady place to sit and just started writing the words and ideas i so desperately wanted to connect but hadnt been able to on the computer </s>
<s> i drew lines around words dots connecting phrases made pyramids and charts and circled and underlined tearing off pages as though i was a brilliant scientist or composer in some film montage </s>

<s> when i returned to the computer the ideas i had been wrestling with all morning fell neatly into place </s>
<s> my breakthrough didnt come by way of any flash of genius or divine inspiration but thanks to the proven benefits of analogue design </s>
<s> in a world where digital interfaces devices and processes are ubiquitous and immensely powerful analogue ideas and methods are enjoying a resilience precisely because of what they uniquely can accomplish </s>
<s> when i speak about analogue i am referring to processes and products  the two distinct phenomena of the design world  which do not require computers or associated digital technology to use </s>
<s> it can be as simple as paper and pen paint and canvas modeling clay or balsa wood or simple electronics and motors to convey an idea </s>
<s> today with highly capable software and hardware on nearly every computer and phone using analogue design is inevitably a conscious choice </s>
<s> but it is one that individuals and organizations are electing to use precisely because it differs so much from the same designs created on a computer </s>
<s> choosing to use analogue processes and products permits design with minimum distraction and interference  there is a reason why every creative worker and aspiring startup titan working in a coffee shop can usually be found toting a journal next to their laptop and phone </s>
<s> paper may be limiting in its physical surface area but what you can do within the page is constrained only by the stroke of a pen </s>
<s> indeed the parameters of a piece of paper and other forms of analogue product are often the kind of limits that spark creativity and invention </s>
<s> software on the other hand is hampered by rules </s>
<s> i cant just freely physically scribble notes on the digital document on which i am typing this article and even if i could it would doubtless feel more cumbersome than putting my pen to paper </s>
<s> there would be issues with saving and formatting with finding the right shape of the pointer to write with and whether that same mark can be seen on a computer writing a different operating system or older version of the software </s>
<s> whether you are an architect sketching a building a consultant scribbling ideas about a presentation a furniture designer holding up fabric swatches or a software designer building a website adopting an analogue approach to the design process changes the very nature of that process </s>
<s> it limits what you can do by space materials and time but in doing so it liberates the imagination to think more freely and creatively </s>
<s> dont believe me </s>
<s> try giving identical pieces of paper to 30 children in a primary school class and see the range of creations that emerges </s>
<s> choosing to use analogue processes and products permits design with minimum distraction and interference  no instagram checking no emails no pinging sounds to interrupt the process </s>

<s> this is why the back of a napkin sketch remains so powerful why whiteboards are a mandatory feature within any innovative workspace and why even silicon valley companies such as google require their designers to take courses on how to sketch their ideas on paper as the first step when they are designing anything new on their websites </s>
<s> design is a fluid process and too often software is an obstacle in the way </s>
<s> many of us can appreciate a beautifully built laptop or sleek digital music player but none of it is meant to endure  but analogue design goes beyond the process to the object itself </s>
<s> among the reasons why the popularity of certain analogue products has been growing again see for example the booming interest in records and turntables film cameras and board games pens and paper is because tangible lasting objects are the best possible showcase for great design </s>

<s> paolo carazana  theres oversized and theres oversized   and then theres italianborn student paolo carzana who sent models down the university of westminster ba catwalk so swamped in humongous layers of distressed coats jackets and trousers that they looked like landfill brought to life </s>
<s> even more startling enormous empty suitlike structures that swayed over models like ominous ghosts </s>
<s> according to carzana however the silhouettes are symbolic protectors fighting on our behalf against the people in power </s>
<s> carzana created an intriguing thoughtprovoking collection which merges fashion and art explains joyce thornton a senior fashion design tutor at westminster </s>

<s> two looks for the price of one then </s>
<s> yingyi lu  for fashion writers gender stereotypical clothing can be frustrating </s>

<s> so when a designer comes up to challenge those assumptions like london college of fashions masters student yingyi lu we can only say great </s>
<s> chineseborn lu was inspired by 19thcentury toy dolls </s>
<s> by exploring gender stereotypes in this way it is very exciting to see how they were used as a starting point to explore the boundaries of masculinity says josé teunissen dean of the school of design and technology at london college of fashion university of the arts london </s>
<s> and its fascinating to see how a female designer from a different cultural background interprets a western heritage and actualises it into contemporary menswear </s>
<s> vin  omi  why wear a little black dress when you can wear a big pink one </s>
<s> this huge pom pom above centre closed the show at vin  omi a progressive and conceptual design house dedicated to creating new planetfriendly fabrics in a luxury environment </s>

<s> so far so utterly contemporary </s>
<s> so why the heliumpartyballoonfilled headdresses that finished the show designed by stephen jones and worn with mashedup ballgowns </s>
<s> its about carrying the weight of the world on your head  but in a light way bovan told vogue </s>
<s> com at the time </s>
<s> given that the collection was dedicated to his beloved grandmother who passed away last summer maybe that makes sense after all </s>
<s> edwin mohney  london fashion week wouldnt be complete without as least one fashion student playing fast and loose with the traditional boundaries of the human body in his work and using the catwalk to air political grievances </s>
<s> this season it was the turn of central saint martins ma fashion graduate edwin mohney born in buffalo new york who set social media ablaze with his swimmingpool skirts pacifier dresses and trumpettos  heels encased in rubber masks of president donald trump </s>
<s> those heels together with the designers stated intention to make fashion great again should give audiences a clue about mohneys inspiration </s>
<s> central saint martins actively encourages progressive thought and boundarybreaking </s>
<s> mohney nailed it </s>
<s> gucci  you expect surreal fashion to appear at the shows of the idealistic young designers  but on the most glamorous runway of the season </s>
<s> hardly </s>
<s> thats exactly what gucci creative director alessandro michele delivered on the labels autumnwinter 2018 catwalk when he turned the show into an event of game of thronesstyle magic and fantasy </s>

<s> maybe weird pays off after all </s>
<s> when the now iconic hope obama poster by shepard fairey went viral it kickstarted a new phase in the visual language of politics </s>
<s> so how are graphics influencing the way we think and communicate now </s>
<s> and what role is graphic iconography playing in political events </s>
<s> a new exhibition at londons design museum  hope to nope graphics and politics 200818  explores these questions presenting some of the worlds most striking examples of protest graphics from the past decade </s>
<s> the swoosh graphic went viral in the runup to the uks last general election spread on social media by supporters of the uks labour party leader jeremy corbyn </s>
<s> so what is it that makes a political graphic have impact </s>
<s> margaret cubbage curator at the design museum tells bbc culture i think the importance is demonstrating the emotion that motivates individuals to be politically active </s>
<s> the artwork that is authentic and connects with the messages of their fellow protesters has impact </s>
<s> the graphics seen in protest is reactive and immediate demonstrating passion and commitment </s>
<s> there is a new democratisation in the graphics of protest according to lucienne roberts of graphicdesign who is cocurating the exhibition much of the important design that relates to politics is produced by unnamed amateurs roberts tells bbc culture </s>
<s> or by designers forced to use pseudonyms for their own safety and is significant as much because of the context in which it is produced as the end result </s>
<s> the dynamic has changed between artist and audience thanks largely to the internet and social media says roberts </s>
<s> new spaces and systems for graphic communication now exist integrating images and text in twoway conversations that make users part of the process no longer simply recipients of information </s>
<s> facebook posts twitter feeds 4chan snapchat and instagram may be virtual environments but their pervasiveness and influence have had a profound impact on the physical world </s>
<s> not that the traditional format of the political banner poster placard or slogan garment has become irrelevant </s>
<s> far from it says roberts they are still relevant and powerful </s>
<s> they exist alongside the digital within a proliferation of visual messages delivered instantaneously to our devices wherever we are </s>
<s> this has led some to feel more invested in world events more able to effect change or influence debate </s>
<s> conversely it has been argued that this is part of a dumbingdown or propagandist process and that nuance and subtlety can be lost technology may have empowered grassroots activists making them more of a challenge to the political establishment says roberts </s>
<s> but it has also resulted in targeted campaigns by politicalinterest groups designed to set people against one another and even destabilise political systems </s>
<s> some political campaigns have adopted an approach similar to corporate branding in which a slogan or symbol or image is created and adopted en masse </s>
<s> as margaret cubbage says the individuals take on a collective identity either for protection or to hide identity but the visual impact is striking </s>
<s> this approach was evident in brazil with the symbol of the duck the umbrella was representative and visually present in occupy central and the global protests in solidarity to the charlie hebdo attacks used the je suis charlie graphic </s>
<s> whatever the format or medium whether slogan tshirt placard or meme the strong protest graphic stands out because its message grabs the attention quickly </s>
<s> they need to communicate at speed catching the eye sparking the imagination  and are often highly targeted </s>
<s> at the other end of the spectrum are protests where there is a broad range of expression and a diversity in the message </s>
<s> protesters display their anger joy or fear through creating their own placards and using what material they have available says margeret cubbage of the design museum </s>
<s> this approach was particularly noticeable in the recent womens protests </s>
<s> this is either resourceful using anything to hand that can be used as a platform to express political opinion or can be a festival of witty colourful messages to project their messages and be heard </s>
<s> the most prevalent and prominent graphic of recent years is the representation of donald trump says margaret cubbage </s>
<s> it doesnt matter if you are politically engaged or not you will recognise him and be aware of his traits and leadership qualities </s>
<s> the distinctive work of cubanborn illustrator edel rodriguez has gained huge currency adds cocurator lucienne roberts </s>
<s> he arrived in the us as a child a fact that informs much of his work </s>
<s> endlessly inventive and full of wit he has created numerous images of trump including cover commissions for time the new yorker and der spiegel </s>
<s> the uks proremain im in graphic went viral on social media just one example of how digital technology has changed the landscape of graphic design </s>
<s> the story of graphics and politics since 2008 is of course dominated by new technology says roberts </s>
<s> it has opened up new ways to connect individuals and causes to harvest and filter data identify patterns predict preferences and shape political strategies </s>
<s> it has transformed public engagement in politics affecting the production control and reach of political messaging  and its visual forms </s>
<s> technology has also democratised graphic design </s>
<s> anyone with access to a computer or smartphone can design using text and images and share their output widely via social media </s>
<s> the womens marches held on the first day of trumps presidency and one year later were notable for the widespread use of placards banners and posters </s>
<s> as roberts points out in 2017 nearly 4 </s>
<s> 5 million people in 914 marches protested against trumps attitude to womens and minority rights among other issues </s>
<s> participants carried handmade angry and often witty placards or wore handknitted pink pussy hats referring to trumps boast about grabbing women with impunity </s>
<s> many of these items were clearly designed with </s>
<s> social media in mind and some even used english in non englishspeaking countries to widen appeal </s>
<s> both marginalized and established voices have been heard through graphics in the past decade </s>
<s> for lucienne roberts this can only be a good thing for society type and image are shown to give shape to political messages across the globe </s>
<s> as traditional media rub shoulders with the hashtag and the meme it is clear that graphic design is critical in giving us all a political voice </s>
<s> the celebrated graphic designer milton glaser was critical of pieces that satisfy their maker and express their rage but do not transform other peoples visions </s>
<s> it is a sentiment that the design museums margaret cubbage agrees with she says </s>
<s> thanks  </s>
<s> to technology graphic design now shapes movements as well as being the medium for their messages </s>
<s> our intention however is that the works collected demonstrate the pivotal role that graphic design plays in not only responding to the political moments of our time but also in challenging changing and dictating them </s>
<s> long excluded from the museum world proper fashion has in recent years found a foothold in some of the worlds most prominent institutions many of which were previously dedicated solely to what the establishment deemed to be art </s>
<s> jewellery too has faced an uphill battle to be accepted by the club and to be shown alongside old school art </s>
<s> the situation is gradually changing </s>
<s> a new exhibition at la musée des arts décoratifsin paris from calder to koons jewellery by artists is part of that change </s>
<s> two hundred  pieces from french collector diane venet form the backbone of the show which puts on display 260 jewellery creations 60 are loans </s>
<s> the exhibition features 150 artists including man ray yayoi kusama pablo picasso damien hirst ai weiwei and louise bourgeois </s>
<s> it is one of the largest artist jewellery exhibitions ever to be assembled venet tells bbc culture </s>
<s> bernar venet   french collector diane venet has amassed one of the most significant collections of jewellery by artists worldwide </s>
<s> the story began more than 30 years ago when venets husband the sculptor bernar venet wrapped a piece of silver around her finger creating an engagement ring and igniting her interest in what she calls the overlooked world of jewellery made by artists </s>
<s> the ring which is on show alongside a largerscale mirrorimage sculpture by bernar venet launches this surprising journey as venet calls it </s>
<s> i started it all because my husband gave me a ring </s>
<s> from there he gave me other pieces and so i went on for 30 years collecting pieces from artists venet says </s>
<s> often what you find here are personal stories pieces made by an artist not for commerce but for somebody she adds </s>
<s> i dont think its a tradition </s>
<s> i think its a challenge for these artists </s>
<s> they pick it up when they want to do it when they have time sometimes when they meet me and like me </s>
<s> its random </s>
<s> its often about friendship </s>
<s> in my case with my husband its a love story </s>
<s> their glittering creations are shown alongside examples of their works of art creating a reference point for their jewellery designs </s>
<s> inspirational objects including african sculptures are also shown </s>
<s> some of these jewellery pieces have a personal meaning for venet too </s>
<s> i collected ceramics with my father from vallauris because we had a house near there </s>
<s> this was a present from my father she says pointing to a piece shown inside a display cabinet that features picassos golden medallions a ceramic necklace and a smiling golden pendant called le grande faune </s>
<s> picassos jewellerymaking began as a happy accident says venet </s>
<s> he asked a friend the french goldsmith françois hugo to cast some of a damaged plates decoration in gold </s>
<s> hugo then created a limited edition of some of picassos medallions and brooches </s>
<s> you can recognise the master in the pieces </s>
<s> you recognise him very well says venet </s>
<s> one of the most prolific artist makers of jewellery georges braque collaborated with jeweller herger de lowenfeld to create 110 gouaches brooches rings and necklaces </s>
<s> in 1963 there was an exhibition of these works </s>
<s> twelve of the pieces are now part of frances state collection </s>
<s> braque decorated his dainty pieces in precious stones including agate jasper turquoise and rubies </s>
<s> man ray  stunning jewellery by surrealist artists including man ray salvador dali giorgio di chirico and jean cocteau form a second section of the exhibition </s>
<s> here a lamp that inspired a pair of man rays spiralling golden earrings  worn by catherine deneuve  is on display alongside an experimental optictopic mask that he created with jeweller giancarlo montebello </s>
<s> the jeweller  collaborated with many artists to realise their pieces  very few artists make or made their own </s>
<s> meanwhile a chunky golden fish pendant is among the eyecatching designs from max ernst as well as a triangular brooch that has lost a corner and gained a pair of empty eyes </s>
<s> you can see a connection between ernsts sculptures and the pieces says venet </s>
<s> salvador dali  most artists made just a few pieces and sometimes only one venet says </s>
<s> one of the most prolific and an exception was salvador dali whose pieces include a brooch fashioned in the shape of a spoon </s>
<s> i love this dali piece because it is so surrealist she says </s>
<s> it is one of my favourites </s>
<s> it displays such a sense of humour </s>
<s> look a watch a spoon and a comb combined </s>
<s> dali did a lot she adds </s>
<s> he also did a lot with precious stones </s>
<s> its a challenge to do it small when they are used to creating it big </s>
<s> it has to have meaning </s>
<s> some have difficulty finding it in something like this </s>
<s> alexander calder  several swirling bronzed designs from the prolific alexander calder form a highlight of the exhibition </s>
<s> as well as spirals calder favoured nonluxury materials including steel hammered brass wire and occasionally gold </s>
<s> calder is rare in that he made the pieces himself </s>
<s> altogether he made around 2000 jewellery designs some of which now belong to venet </s>
<s> calder is very special because his are always unique pieces </s>
<s> you would invite him for dinner </s>
<s> he would come with a nail she says </s>
<s> niki de saint palle  the french feminist artist niki de saint phalle is perhaps best remembered for her voluptuous female sculptures or nanas which challenged perceived roles of women </s>
<s> between 1971 and 1991 she also collaborated with montebello to realise bright ceramic designs </s>
<s> several of her pieces are shown in a cabinet alongside a doll pendant by grayson perry </s>
<s> louise bourgeois  spiders and sexuality are recurring themes in the art of feminist artist louise bourgeois </s>
<s> two of her jewellery pieces on display show her favourite obsessions including a spidershaped brooch made for her mother and a necklace that looks like a chastity belt </s>
<s> lucio fontana and fausto melotti  the second hall of the exhibition has been divided into national and thematic sections </s>
<s> it begins by showing jewellery from a prolific set of italian artists that were ahead of the crowd says venet </s>
<s> they began making jewellery in the late 1950s </s>
<s> display pieces include a bracelet that resembles a pink surfboard designed by lucio fontana in 1967 and a unique gold necklace by sculptor fausto melotti which comprises a dangling arrangement of finely curved golden chord hanging from a simple golden ring </s>
<s> other nationalities followed on later she says </s>
<s> the british were quite late </s>
<s> pop art  venet began collecting jewellery by artists when she lived in new york so the collection includes a significant number of american artists including her friend frank stella who agreed to make her a piece after months of begging </s>
<s> he finally presented her with a necklace badly wrapped in newspaper </s>
<s> its fragile structure resembles a golden butterfly in motion </s>
<s> the two also collaborated on a ring </s>
<s> what interests me the most is the intimate story says venet </s>
<s> its never for commercial reasons </s>
<s> its usually for friendship or love </s>
<s> i lived in new york for 20 years so often these artists were friends of mine </s>
<s> it was relatively easy to ask them </s>
<s> the first piece she ever bought was a lichtenstein brooch that was a souvenir from an exhibition </s>
<s> i bought it for three dollars </s>
<s> one sold recently for 5000 she says </s>
<s> other artists  the exhibition includes works by artists from around the globe including chinas ai weiwei and russias ilya and emilia kabako </s>
<s> there are a number of edgy creations from british artists including tim noble and sue webster anish kapoor gavin turk and damien hirst </s>
<s> one of the most striking objects on display is a ring by the greek artist jannis kounellis which is a mould of his lips and one of the more inventive pieces featured is a goldplated potato design by jacqueline de jong </s>
<s> synonymous with gatsbystyle glamour and the jazz age the bold sleek art deco era was a gamechanging time in design </s>
<s> its angular geometric aesthetic celebrated the exciting new worlds of industry speed mechanisation and technology </s>
<s> it was a uniquely lively and eclectic time in design and spanned the opulent roaring 20s to the more austere 1930s </s>
<s> art deco design has endured like no other style and it is in jewellery that the eras influence has proved particularly lasting </s>
<s> having reemerged over the decades jewellery inspired by the art deco era is once again enjoying a revival today  the bold innovative sensibility of the time has been hard to miss in recent years both in fine jewellery and costume styles </s>
<s> so what was it about art deco jewellery that set it apart and made it significant </s>
<s> the art deco style really is about modernity dennis nothdruft senior curator at londons fashion and textile museum tells bbc culture </s>
<s> the jewellery of the period encapsulated the elements of the style in such a clear and exquisite way  geometries sleek lines shine and sparkle </s>
<s> it was such sophisticated work and perfectly set off the fashions of the day </s>
<s> originally called style moderne the new design aesthetic was famously showcased at the international exhibition of modern decorative and industrial arts in paris in 1925 </s>
<s> and even before this some jewellers had already been forging the new look  as nothdruft explains i find cartier the classic art deco jeweler </s>
<s> as a company they were already exploring modern styling before the art deco exhibition what they went on to produce were classics of the era </s>
<s> beside the jewellery things like cigarette cases and watches were also masterpieces in miniature </s>
<s> and the look keeps reemerging nothdruft adds as a style the art deco cycles through periodically </s>
<s> it always signals sophistication and glamour </s>
<s> what does change is how jewellery is worn  perhaps layering pieces instead of one necklace or one bracelet </s>
<s> i see ideas for jewellery everywhere the wheels the cars the machinery of today  raymond templier  after the detailed intricacies and excesses of the art nouveau style the abstract clean angular lines of the art deco era marked a new daring sensibility and drew heavily on the dynamic mood of the newly mechanised urban world </s>
<s> typical of this structured geometric look is the jewellery of raymond templier some of which is in the permanent collection at londons va museum including a brooch from around 1930 </s>
<s> templier commented in the goldsmiths journal at the time as i walk in the streets i see ideas for jewellery everywhere the wheels the cars the machinery of today </s>
<s> he was known as the architect of the jewel </s>
<s> the art deco jewels were typified by sleekness and sharpness of edges with a regularity about the lines surface and volume </s>
<s> interesting and unusual blends of gems and materials were introduced for the first time with natural materials such as onyx rock crystal jade ivory and silver combined with manmade ones such as glass and plastic </s>
<s> by the end of the 1920s a paredback icy look became fashionable and minimalist rings appeared with a rigour and severity about them </s>
<s> the favoured metal was platinum and because of its strength less was needed giving great prominence to the gems </s>
<s> a clean break  a recent sale at christies beyond boundaries magnificent jewels from a european collection showcased some of the eras most outstanding pieces </s>
<s> it showed how the end of world war one ushered in a rejection of the excesses of the edwardian and belle epoque eras </s>
<s> it was a time of great change and upheaval and the art deco design movement emerged from the chaos of war presenting a clean sweep </s>
<s> while designers came from diverse backgrounds they all held the same ideal to make a clean break from the past draw inspiration from everyday life and rid the decorative arts of useless ornamentation says laurence mouillefarine a historian of the art deco era </s>
<s> cartier van cleef  arpels paul brandt raymond templier and fouquet are among the jewelers who created masterful geometric looks from a stunning deco sapphire ring by raymond templier to an emerald ring and a diamondandonyx ring both by jean fouquet all recently sold by christies geneva </s>
<s> in laterperiod art deco structural clips and doubleclip brooches became fashionable and along with an emphasis on geometric design there was also a focus on contrasts in colour and rock crystals were often set beside diamonds heightening the gems sparkle </s>
<s> egyptian chinese and japanese art and motifs were also an inspiration with the frequent inclusion of coral enamels pearls lacquer and jade </s>
<s> some designs even lifted  or appropriated  motifs from asian art </s>
<s> jewellery specialist at christies auction house raymond sancroftbaker says after wwi people wanted to embrace the new </s>
<s> art deco took hold and cartier was at the forefront of innovation </s>
<s> it introduced the tank watch in 1917 and after jacques cartier had travelled to india in search of gemstones tutti frutti jewellery which became very popular in the 1920s </s>
<s> one must remember that jewellery is after all a fashion ornament and having the latest design is always important </s>
<s> sancroftbaker explains that jacques cartier first visited india in 1911 and through his buying agents in delhi calcutta and bombay managed to acquire indian rubies sapphires and emeralds carved with floral motifs at modest prices </s>
<s> the workshops in paris assimilated indian designs into a new style of multigem jewels that were far removed from the typical severity of purely diamondbased art deco jewels he says </s>
<s> the genre reached its crescendo with a stunning necklace the collier hindou which was commissioned in 1936 by the heiress to the singer sewing machine company daisy fellowes </s>
<s> cartier items from the era are highly collectible  a sleek diamond emerald enamel and onyx bracelet made for the paris exhibition of 1925 was also sold through christies recently </s>
<s> and a pair of streamlined art deco diamond bracelets by the jeweller originally from the collection of doris duke sold in 2017 for nearly 1 million 706000 at christies new york </s>
<s> the long strands of pearls were layered elegantly by the chic flappers of the time  also a fashionable choice in the 1920s and 30s was tiffany bringing new diamond cuts contrasting round and baguette brilliant diamonds clustered together in stylised blooms </s>
<s> tiffany pearls worn several ropes together were particularly popular with the long strands layered elegantly by the chic flappers of the time </s>
<s> tiffany now takes a contemporary approach to art deco principles maintaining the geometry and fluid settings of the sleek originals and the jewellers art deco inspired pieces today are among some of their most popular items </s>
<s> tiffanys yellowdiamond ring features a large gem in platinum bedecked with roundandbaguette white diamonds is clearly inspired by the era </s>
<s> also influenced by its own 1920s creations is a collection inspired by the iconic zeigfeld theatre including a sterling silver ring with a round blackonyx and freshwater cultured pearls </s>
<s> jewellery designer carat london is also among the broad spectrum of accessible independent brands now influenced by art deco sensibilities </s>
<s> heidi thompson creative director of carat london is inspired by the architecture and décor of the era she tells bbc designed particularly in the brands chrysler collection </s>
<s> obviously the iconic chrysler building in new york city was the main inspiration </s>
<s> our mood boards included patterns from not only the exterior of the building but also the wallpaper geometric compositions in paintings and furniture and the beautiful details of the wrought iron gate </s>
<s> so why does thompson think this style of jewellery resonates so much now </s>
<s> fashion is an eternal renewal and art deco is one of the most chic and feminine periods in fashion history </s>
<s> this era speaks to women of all ages and reminds us of the opulence of great parties and beautiful dresses </s>
<s> every woman dreams of having a gatsby moment </s>

<s> and moreover if it is possible for artworks themselves to actually interfere in political and social structures what does that disruption look like </s>
<s> of course sabotage isnt simply about breaking things </s>
<s> sabotage is breaking things so that something else something different can happen </s>
<s> appetite for destruction  in terms of destroying art itself one might think of gustave courbets successful proposal in 1871 to topple and disassemble the vendôme column during the events of the paris commune a monument he claimed was devoid of all artistic value tending to perpetuate by its expression the ideas of war and conquest of the past imperial dynasty </s>
<s> or more recently of british artist hannah blacks conversationfueling but unsuccessful 2017 open letter requesting that dana schutzs painting open casket which reproduced the famous image of emmett till at his funeral be removed from the whitney biennial and destroyed </s>
<s> both of these cases however are gestures of framing </s>
<s> the proposals to topple the column and ruin the painting are not artworks in themselves </s>
<s> by contrast in 1995 the chinese artist ai weiwei did indeed make an artwork dropping a han dynasty urn by destroying another artwork </s>
<s> his performance is represented in three blackandwhite photos the artist holds the 2000yearoldceremonial vase it is caught in midair it shatters on the floor </s>

<s> and on a symbolic level the action represents a rejection of the legacies of the han dynasty 206 bce220 ce a defining period in chinese history </s>
<s> in this way he provokes the viewer to consider who determines cultural and monetary values alike </s>
<s> but this all plays out only on the level of representation no political or social system is impeded </s>
<s> efforts of art world sabotage are often directed instead at the institutions that support art reflecting artists frustrations with issues of visibility and accessibility </s>
<s> we might trace this to the 1863 salon des refusés when courbet édouard manet james mcneill whistler and others rejected from the paris salon displayed their work under the auspices of emperor napoleon iii in another venue at the palace of industry </s>

<s> these projects sabotage the very concept of what an artwork can and should be </s>
<s> but to return to the opening question what artworks actually do serve to interfere with political and social structures </s>
<s> hardpressed i can think of only a handful that supersede the fraught dynamics of art life and power to intervene in systems while maintaining rigor in form or concept  works of art that actually do have purpose and effect on the real world </s>
<s> in 1997 the german artist christoph schlingensief pulled off one such work when he organised tötet helmut kohl </s>

<s> schlingensief and abu hamdan alike disrupted a status quo to force a change </s>
<s> of course sabotage is mischievous </s>
<s> often it is an intervention that begins as a minor interference that multiplies or magnifies to result in the destruction of a system </s>
<s> and often it is perpetrated anonymously </s>
<s> this relationship to duration and authorlessness alone makes true sabotage an irksome task for artists </s>

<s> modern chinese artist zhang daqian 18991983 who met picasso in nice in 1956 also displayed a similar persona </s>

<s> not only did he inherit the roots of traditional chinese landscape paintings and invent new artistic language in his bold splashink paintings and portraits of women he was also known for his affairs with many women and had four wives </s>
<s> but beyond the romantic details of his biography the aesthetics of picassos paintings are what appeal to the chinese  much more so than other big names of western art such as claude monet and vincent van gogh </s>
<s> wong says picassos portraits speak to modern china as portraits have played an important role in modern and contemporary chinese art particularly since 1949 </s>
<s> mainland chinese artists were trained to follow the soviet school of social realism where portraits play a key role in the works of chinese artists from chen yifei to zhang xiaogang </s>
<s> chinese people over the past century are accustomed to the appreciation of portraits he says </s>
<s> but thats not the only factor says wong </s>
<s> chinese people who grew up with the multipleperspective style in traditional landscape paintings would find it easier to connect with picassos cubist portraits </s>

<s> picasso told okamoto that he possessed several japanese woodblock prints and that they were not refined ones but earlier more primitive ones he says </s>
<s> to picasso primitive does not mean something uncultured but rather it is the other way of representation than the traditional western style based on perception and accurate realistic description </s>
<s> asian tradition of representation is different from the western style and it is not perceptional but more conceptual </s>
<s> in that sense picassos way of expressing something is familiar with asian people </s>

<s> it is said he would have preferred to call the painting to my critics </s>
<s> although the ministry stood by him when jurisprudence which featured a penitent encircled by a formless squidlike creature caused further disquiet a decision was made to permanently display the paintings in a gallery rather than on the ceiling </s>

<s> still for all that sticking grand masters in a salt mine might sound sacrilegious at least it was dark and cool  not actually the worst conditions for the paintings </s>
<s> and one of the things that is fascinating about the history of manod is that the relocation of 1800 paintings to wales ultimately ushered in a significant new era of conservation for the institution </s>
<s> explosives were used to enlarge the entrance of the mine so the biggest works could fit in and a railway system inside the caves was developed to move the paintings around </s>

<s> having to move to manod meant a lot of thinking and research about how best to house the collection and a team was able to closely monitor the paintings in controlled conditions </s>
<s> there was a small studio built outside the quarry where they did a lot of conservation work it was actually a very formative time for the gallery says mooreede </s>
<s> after the war major renovations were needed anyway following bomb damage to the gallery and so air conditioning was added and a new scientific department established </s>

<s> but this month the 47yearold is releasing an album with a collaborator he could never have dreamt of working with </s>
<s> its not a singer or rapper </s>
<s> its not even really a musician </s>
<s> its called flow machines and it is arguably the worlds most advanced artificially intelligent music program </s>
<s> recently its often felt like ai is about to take over the music world  that soon computers will be making our favourite songs </s>
<s> ai has been used to write classical music and irish folk songs </s>
<s> startups like jukedeck amper music and melodrive have developed ai that can make tunes in the style of your choosing synth pop dreamy electronica at the click of a button </s>
<s> tech giants are involved too googles magenta project has developed several ai music tools including a synth that can meld sounds together such as a sitars pluck with a cows moo </s>
<s> why exactly youd want to do that is another matter </s>
<s> for musicians theres been one good thing about these projects so far the music theyve produced has been easy to dismiss generic and uninspiring  hardly likely to challenge bob dylan in the songwriting department </s>
<s> but carrés album hello world is different for the simple reason that itsgood </s>
<s> released under the name skygge danish for shadow it features everything from scifi cowboy ballads to europop and unlike most ai music if you heard it on the radio you wouldnt think something had gone horribly wrong </s>
<s> because of that its likely to prompt a lot of apocalyptic headlines along the lines of a computer can write europop who needs musicians anymore </s>
<s>  theres just one problem with that view its wrong </s>
<s> the philosophy of the project is to develop a creative tool to help artists but people dont want to hear that says carré </s>
<s> they want to hear that the musicians will be replaced </s>
<s> flow machines developed at sonys computer science laboratories in paris does indeed write original melodies carré adds </s>
<s> it also suggests the chords and sounds to play them with </s>
<s> but carré says a human is always needed to stitch the songs together give them structure and emotion </s>
<s> without people its songs would be a bit rubbish </s>
<s> there were many people involved in this he says listing the likes of belgian house producer stromae and canadian pop star kiesza </s>
<s> they gave their soul their enthusiasm </s>
<s> i think thats the most important point of the album in a way  that its a very human one </s>
<s> go with the flow  the rush to create ai music is nothing new says margaret schedel a composer and cellist who is also codirector of computer music at stony brook university in new york </s>
<s> people have been using computers to write classical music since the 1950s </s>
<s> computers have also long been able to produce music thats better than people </s>
<s> in the 1980s xavier rodet a french academic got a computer to sing part of mozarts the magic flute  and just by keeping it in tune it was better than most amateur opera singers </s>
<s> todays ai researchers are simply extending that work just using the latest technology like artificial neural networks  modelled on the brain  that allow computers to learn by doing in the same way that a person does </s>
<s> how do these systems work </s>
<s> most including flow machines require someone to feed dozens of music scores into the system </s>
<s> the ai will then analyse the scores to spot patterns such as how the chords change or how long melodies last and then itll spit out its own short tunes in response </s>
<s> for the flow machines record stromae fed some of his favourite cape verdian music into it to compose one song for another track carré used his favourite samba song as the input </s>
<s> schedel says ai systems are already very good at rulebased music like fugues a type of classical music in which the melody is repeated using different voices or chillout songs where you essentially just need the sound of a wave hitting a beach to sound convincing </s>
<s> ninetynine per cent of ai generated fugues are better than what my students can write she says with a laugh </s>
<s> but when you move into more complicated or human music  like a pop or folk songs  ai struggles </s>
<s> music is so complicated </s>
<s> it has so many dimensions that if you get one part of it wrong people are just like eugh </s>
<s>  she says </s>
<s> its harder to trick our ears than our eyes </s>
<s> and with a lot of ai music you sort of dip into that uncanny valley where its like this is not quite right </s>
<s>   that means right now people are needed to make ai music sound good </s>
<s> but dont put that in your piece she adds with a laugh as then the ai people will come and get me </s>
<s> the benefits and limitations of a system like flow machines are obvious if you talk with those who have used it </s>
<s> its a bit like having somebody playing a piano in the corner of your studio says michael lovett of the electronic band nzca lines who coproduced hello world </s>
<s> theyre kind of playing stuff and most of its rubbish but at some points youre like oh whats that </s>
<s> thats interesting </s>
<s>  and itll become the jumpingoff point for a song </s>
<s> cyborg music  lovett wrote multi mega fortune for the album a futuristic funk track with an addictive highpitched chorus </s>
<s> to put it together he fed a lot of his favourite american rb tunes into flow machines to do this he had to write them into musical notation  the system does not work with mp3s </s>
<s> the ai then analysed them and spat out 810 short melodies at a time which lovett would trawl until he found something he liked </s>
<s> hed then make it generate tunes again and again stitching the melodies together altering them and building on them to create the song </s>
<s> it was a long process he says </s>
<s> but it was kind of amazing how quickly we came up with something that i felt was like oh thats a catchy melody </s>
<s>   i dont know whether its by virtue of the algorithm or just luck </s>
<s> the system is a great foil for musicians lovett adds rather like a pushy bandmate who challenges you to get out of your comfort zone </s>
<s> i wouldnt have written the melodies that ended up being in that track if id done it by myself </s>
<s> i think it could become a very widely accepted technology if its made more userfriendly and accessible </s>
<s> it does slightly scare him though that one day someone might make an ai that can churn out music without people </s>
<s> record companies could just say to it we want a new rock song in the style of u2 hit a button and itd spit out dozens of complete songs </s>
<s> hopefully im not in 20 years one of those people who has been responsible for the downfall of creative music he says </s>
<s> schedel who is a musician as well as an academic agrees this could be a worry and says youll likely see ai take over fields like jingle writing and video game music in the near future </s>
<s> i used to get money to write up little introducton to my youtube channel songs she says </s>
<s> why would you pay a real person 50 bucks when you could pay an ai 2 and you cant tell the difference </s>
<s>   but she adds if the ai is better than 95 of random musicians off the street is that so bad </s>
<s>  ultimately though she thinks the reason people should be excited rather than worried about ai music is it might push us somewhere new </s>
<s> what im super excited about is cyborg music  the combination of human and machine intelligences she says </s>
<s> i think we can really absolutely use machines to augment our own creativity and create music that neither humans or computers could make by themselves </s>
<s> i think thats thrilling </s>
<s> she also points out a simple reason the computers arent going to take over anytime soon  musics a communal activity we all like live shows </s>
<s> how long until the future of ai music becomes clear and we know whos won the humans or the machines </s>
<s> honestly who knows </s>
<s> its not even clear what the future of flow machines is </s>

<s> the opera ends with carmen meeting him outside the local bullring and telling him once and for all she doesnt love him he stabs her and declares oh carmen my beloved as the curtains close </s>

<s> his motto was semper dowland semper dolens </s>
<s> this means always dowland always doleful pierre huard an early music performer and researcher tells bbc culture </s>
<s> like leonard cohen or tom waits in other words john dowland the angsty musician was sometimes indistinguishable from his music </s>

<s> sixteenthcentury england was obsessed with melancholy seeing it as </s>
<s> fashionable says olga hernandez roldan a lecturer in music history at the madrid superior school of singing </s>
<s> ted libbey a music critic agrees </s>
<s> melancholy was the sign of a superior individual he wrote in an article for npr </s>
<s> it was typical of someone who was mature and capable of deep feeling </s>
<s> these ideas seeped into 16th century life </s>
<s> one scholar wrote a treatise on melancholy while shakespeare cast hamlet as bubbling with existential worries </s>
<s> like all the best modern musicians meanwhile dowland tapped into these feelings </s>
<s> if ed sheerans galway girl sates modern teenagers desperate for tipsy nostalgia dowland filled his songs with the passions of his time </s>
<s> dowlands music was strikingly modern in other ways too </s>
<s> he was one of the first composers to popularise the lute in england spreading his music to a mass audience </s>
<s> like the piano a few centuries later it could be produced cheaply and made music accessible to the bourgeoisie explains hernandez roldan </s>
<s> the lute allowed people to play printed music at home on their own she adds </s>
<s> dowlands music soon became wildly popular and one of his song books was reprinted four times during the late 1500s and early 1600s </s>
<s> together with his instrument moreover dowland pushed for a new kind of music </s>
<s> unlike the dense italian madrigals of the previous century many of dowlands songs were organised simply with just an intimate solo lute as accompaniment says huard </s>
<s> they had a big effect on the public and helped turn english into a european language </s>
<s> shakespeare of songs  given all this its little wonder that dowland is now known by some as the first modern singersongwriter although not everyone agrees </s>
<s> we must root dowland in his musical context to appreciate the whole says hernandez roldan </s>
<s> i feel that to speak about him just ripped out of his world makes no sense </s>
<s> she has a point scratching a line right from dowland to modern musicians risks slipping into anachronism </s>
<s> still if dowland did not wear a black leather jacket his gushy selfexpression  combined with his simple intense style  are both hallmarks of modern pop </s>
<s> for huard dowland is nothing short of a timeless shakespeare of songs whose vivid delivery jumps down to us as strong as ever </s>
<s> and if some historians might hesitate to make the comparison between dowland and contemporary music artists have happily adapted his passionate songs </s>
<s> twentiethcentury composers like benjamin britten and parry grainger have reimagined pieces by dowland </s>

<s> naturally not all these musicians were influenced by dowland directly </s>

<s> martin luther father of protest </s>
<s> the reformers music forged a path for we shall overcome and give peace a chance writes andrea valentino </s>
<s>     by andrea valentino   24 may 2017  tomorrow the brandenburg gate to his back barack obama will give a landmark speech in honour of martin luther and the protestant reformation </s>
<s> the speech marks a high point in a frenetic year of celebration </s>
<s> dozens of new books and exhibits are marking the 500th anniversary of his revolution </s>
<s> playmobil a toy company has even released a dinky luther figurine </s>
<s> all this is unsurprising by turning against many of the major teachings of the catholic church and publishing a complete translation of the bible into german martin luther pushed europe towards the modern world </s>
<s> but if europe is still shaped by luthers political and religious legacy his musical contributions are less famous </s>
<s> in fact music was crucial to his ideology and encouraged radical singers long after his death </s>
<s> his popular musical style meanwhile is immediately comparable with some of the most wellknown protest movements of the modern age </s>
<s> before 1517 the catholic church controlled most religious music in europe </s>
<s> lay participation was minimal </s>
<s> in church most people only heard austere plainchant sung in latin by a choir </s>
<s> passion plays  rowdy dramas describing biblical stories  introduced religious ideas to people in their own languages </s>
<s> but by the 16th century these plays had often slumped into an excuse for slapstick humour </s>
<s> and anyway vernacular music rarely crossed the church threshold </s>
<s> luther shattered these strict divisions and transformed christian musical life </s>
<s> for him religious music was not just for remote priests and choirs </s>
<s> instead it was next to theology and a gift from god </s>
<s> as such it should be accessible to everyone </s>
<s> after all he wrote by embellishing and ornamenting their tunes in wonderful ways singers could lead others into a heavenly dance </s>
<s> anyone who disagreed deserved to hear nothing but the braying of asses and the grunting of hogs </s>
<s>   luther scrabbled to develop these ideas as fiercely as he did his thoughts on the pope or the evils of indulgences where time in purgatory could be slashed in return for a handy payment to the local priest </s>
<s> latin chanting was dumped in favour of communal singing in everyday german </s>
<s> this style soon became a key part of his followers identity </s>
<s> luthers use of german hymns was an important sign of change explains andreas loewe dean of st pauls cathedral in melbourne and luther expert </s>
<s> it was just as obvious as having married clergy or being able to receive a cup of wine at holy communion as a lay person </s>
<s> not that luther promoted music just for abstract reasons of faith </s>
<s> he well understood how powerful music was in spreading his message </s>
<s> like the best modern protest songs his hymns were catchy and punchy </s>
<s> he added religious lyrics to recognisable folk songs just as we shall overcome hatched from an old southern gospel song </s>
<s> this was especially useful in an ignorant age </s>
<s> even illiterate people  about 85 of the german population in 1500  could learn songs and pass them on quickly </s>
<s> music as message  luther himself pushed these changes along </s>
<s> he encouraged children to learn music at school and worked with other reformers to produce protestant hymnbooks </s>
<s> luther also wrote lyrics that imitated the way people spoke says loewe </s>
<s> luther himself stated that both music and lyrics should grow out of the true mother tongue </s>
<s> ein feste burg a mighty fortress is typical of his rousing simplicity  our god is a mighty fortress a trusty shield and weapon </s>
<s> songs like this stiffened the hearts of luther and his friends </s>
<s> they likely sang ein feste burg at the diet of worms when luther was interrogated by charles v the holy roman emperor </s>
<s> this has striking parallels with more modern protest movements </s>
<s> after all antivietnam war protesters rallied to give peace a chance in the face of violent backlash while antiapartheid campaigners sang soweto blues after a racist massacre in south africa </s>
<s> but if luthers music was soothing to supporters his hymns also grabbed new converts </s>
<s> new music buzzed from town to town before the catholic authorities could swat it down </s>
<s> as with other aspects of the reformation the printing press was key </s>
<s> luthers hymns were sold hot off the press as pamphlets and taught to entire cities by travelling singers says loewe </s>
<s> sometimes luthers hymns worked faster than he did </s>
<s> in magdeburg massed singing of his anthems converted the town months before luther arrived </s>
<s> contemporaries valued the spread of this music </s>
<s> writing 50 years after luther died theologian cornelius becker noted that luthers songs were carried to people in faraway places in the souls and minds of pious christians </s>
<s> it was not easy to block their progress </s>
<s> indeed lutheran hymns had soon skipped out of his stronghold in saxony </s>
<s> they were sung in catholic areas and translated into english </s>
<s> all this shares much with modern protest music </s>
<s> just as the socialist anthem the internationale became famous from madrid to moscow  even among people who did not understand the niceties of marxist dogma  lutheran hymns bounced around europe as a snappy mark of solidarity with unknown allies </s>
<s> voices raised  luthers music stayed popular after his death </s>
<s> protestant troops sang lutheran hymns as they went into battle during the thirty years war in the 17th century </s>
<s> later protestant composers also covered his hymns </s>
<s> johann sebastian bach expanded ein feste burg to a glorious 30minute cantata while felix mendelssohn added it to his aptly named reformation symphony </s>
<s> this trend has continued to modern times lutheran hymns still feature in catholic and protestant hymnbooks </s>
<s> for romantic writer heinrich heine ein feste burg was nothing less than the marseillaise of the reformation that has preserved to this day its inspiriting power </s>
<s> like the real marseillaise meanwhile luthers music has proved boundlessly supple </s>
<s> just as french monarchists and russian socialists adapted that revolutionary anthem to their own causes hymns like ein feste burg have hurtled away from their religious origins </s>
<s> richard wagner quoted the song in a piece celebrating prussian victory against france in 1871 </s>
<s> later the nazis justified terror by abusing luthers biblical reference to the old evil foe </s>
<s> but lutheran music never lost its radical muscle </s>
<s> during the 1848 revolution liberals sang a new version of ein feste burg to promote freedom and truth </s>
<s> in the 1880s german social democrats rewrote the same hymn to include references to human rights </s>
<s> a century later opponents of a new nuclear waste plant used ein feste burg to attack the armed police </s>
<s> loewe notices the irony here </s>
<s> just as the reformer took stirring tunes and composed new words for them he explains so many protest movements used luthers tunes to promote ideas other than luthers own </s>
<s> this feels fitting </s>
<s> through his hymns luther is grandfather of a musical revolution that shared and adapted united in stomping change on the world through rousing melodies and simple words </s>
<s> but if martin luther helped spur on modern protest music he can still flicker moments of private contemplation </s>
<s> i never go through a day without listening to some lutheran chorales or organ renditions of great christian music explains martin e marty a religious scholar </s>
<s> andreas loewe agrees </s>
<s> i love to sing he says </s>
<s> whether as part of our worship at st pauls cathedral or with friends or as part of the melbourne symphony orchestra chorus with whom i get to perform a couple of times a year  i share luthers belief that music is a most beautiful and priceless gift of god </s>

<s> one dealer trying to be kind and to offer a practical solution said yours is not the only violin in the world </s>
<s> but one of the most powerful aspects of kyms unique and gripping memoir is how she sheds light on the deeply personal relationship that great classical artists have with their instruments many of which will survive for centuries long outlasting their owners and containing within them ghostly echoes and secrets from the past </s>
<s> she conveys the precision yet mystery of how this particular 17thcentury instrument enabled her own millennial voice and personality to be fully realised despite being 300 years old </s>
<s> in short then this violin was the only one in the world for her </s>
<s> if it had been my child that had been stolen she wonders would people have expected me to accept another one </s>

<s> with the exception of locallysourced wood all the materials were imported from europe and no expense was spared </s>

<s> the dome was a controversial construction and it continues to divide critics according to tour guide samir torres </s>
<s> traditionalists deemed it a bizarre addition  neither formal nor symmetrical nor of utility it does not form part of the interior and the roof had to be reinforced to support its weight </s>

<s> the piece was first performed at the salzburg festival last year and has just had its uk premiere at the royal opera house in london </s>

<s> in the film the panels of the room are painted with religious scenes and there is an angel on this little door </s>
<s> buñuel comes out of a religious education and background says peter william evans professor emeritus of film studies at queen mary university london </s>

<s> it could be any group of humans that are subjected to this sort of ordeal </s>
<s> by the end of the opera he wants all of us of any class to feel the fear of being alive of existence and how things can completely crumble in front of you </s>
<s> in the opera the angel is something quite different from buñuels </s>
<s> it is a distinct presence almost a character in its own right and perhaps even the star the show </s>
<s> adès has represented it with an unusual addition to the orchestra the ondes martenot an electronic instrument whose eerie keening sound  somehow resembling a human voice but at the same time totally otherworldly and strange  has soundtracked a thousand alien landings </s>
<s> the ondes martenot becomes the voice of the exterminating angel adès has said in the sense that the instrument is heard whenever a figure says something that contributes to the situation of immobility </s>
<s> staying put  frustration is a key theme in buñuels films says evans that we are unable to act on our desires for one reason or another </s>

<s> the beatles playing ed sullivan this was not </s>
<s> and yet this was as significant a moment in us musical history </s>
<s> the date was 26 february 1917 and this novelty song livery stable blues by the original dixieland jass band was the first jazz recording </s>
<s> that would be a remarkable milestone in its own right but embedded into livery stable blues are issues that have haunted jazz and popular music as a whole ever since </s>
<s> we all know the debates from elvis to taylor swift over white copycats appropriating the sound and style of black musicians </s>
<s> when they recorded livery stable blues the allwhite original dixieland jass band borrowed to the point of plagiarism from the africanamerican musicians theyd heard in their native new orleans </s>
<s> we follow the legal challenges over who wrote stairway to heaven or whether blurred lines should have listed marvin gaye as a coauthor </s>
<s> livery stable blues one of the first true hit singles selling over one million copies at a time most still preferred to buy sheet music over recordings inspired its own attribution battle </s>
<s> weve all heard the arguments usually from very concerned parents about what defines good taste or aesthetic achievement in popular music </s>
<s> the judge who presided over the lawsuit about who wrote livery stable blues ultimately ruled that since the song was in bad taste and composed by people who couldnt actually read or write sheet music it would be remanded to the public domain with no writer attributed at all </s>
<s> more than other forms of popular music jazz is particularly fraught with these kind of debates but some of the most heated arguments among jazz aficionados are even more fundamental what qualifies as jazz </s>
<s> does jazz have some essential ingredient </s>
<s> where does the term jazz even come from </s>
<s> one hundred years after the first jazz recording the answers remain elusive but the story of livery stable blues shows how early the questions that still surround the genre were raised </s>
<s> word play  jazz was named the word of the 20th century by the american dialect society which is remarkable since we dont actually know for sure from where the term originates </s>
<s> one of the most striking features of jazz to its earliest listeners was its speed its sheer energy </s>
<s> dating back to 1860 there had been an africanamerican slang term jasm which means vim or energy </s>
<s> on 14 november 1916 the new orleans timespicayune newspaper referred for the first time to jas bands </s>
<s> that particular spelling suggests jas could have come from jasm </s>
<s> early jazz pioneer jelly roll morton whose own name was a euphemism for sex first developed his own style playing piano in these sporting houses and to get extra tips hed peek at a prostitute and her client through a peephole and time his playing with the pace of their revels </s>
<s> like jas jass probably has a sexual connotation as a reference to a womans backside </s>
<s> musician eubie blake said in an interview with national public radio before his death in 1983 when broadway picked it up they called it jazz </s>
<s>  it wasnt called that </s>
<s> it was spelled jass </s>
<s>  that was dirty and if you knew what it was you wouldnt say it in front of ladies </s>
<s> or perhaps by the time jass made it to new york city from new orleans bandleaders were simply tired of pranksters scratching off the j from their posters </s>
<s> a few months after that recording of livery stable blues the fivesome would change their name to the original dixieland jazz band for good </s>
<s> livery stable blues also helps answer the question what is jazz </s>
<s>  by pointing to its roots </s>
<s> the song is structured around three chords and into 12 bars like virtually all blues songs emerging from the africanamerican tradition </s>
<s> its barnyard sounds connect it to the setting of the work songs black field labourers would sing </s>
<s> its habanera beat common to so much of jazz reflects the influence of bouncy caribbean melodies on new orleans music  there were several ferries arriving in new orleans from havana every day in the early 20th century </s>
<s> its repetition indicates the callandresponse tradition of black baptist churches </s>
<s> the clarinet cornet and trombone in its arrangement reflect the influence of march music which was wildly popular in new orleans during and after the civil war and resulted in an excess of brass and woodwind instruments floating around the city for wouldbe musicians to play </s>
<s> its piano comes from the tradition of ragtime the musical form that directly proceeded jazz </s>
<s> and its sense of humour comes from minstrelsy the tradition of parodying opera and operettas and poking fun often most insensitively at the racial divide between white and black </s>
<s> minstrelsy most commonly featured white musicians in blackface projecting their own cartoonish idea of what it meant to be black  and it was by far the most popular form of music in the us from 1840 to 1920 </s>
<s> but while minstrelsy involved white americans parodying their idea of africanamericans many other white musicians like those of the original dixieland jass band chose to copy africanamerican musical traditions wholesale </s>
<s> the musical dna in livery stable blues comes from black artists and shows that jazz is a fundamentally africanamerican music even if an allwhite band was first to record it </s>
<s> the particular mix of africanstyle drumbeats and the caribbean rhythm found in this song but so common to jazz as a whole points to the time from 1817 to 1843 when black slaves  some from africa some from the caribbean some from the interior of the american south  would gather on sundays in new orleans congo square to play music and crosspollinate their traditions </s>
<s> new orleans creoles of colour who were the mixedrace descendants of black and white ancestors typically identified more with european culture than with africas </s>
<s> after the jim crow laws of 1890 classified the citys mixedrace creoles as black they were only allowed to play with other black musicians and this brought a greater musical fluency and technical skill to black music because many creoles of colour were trained in classical music </s>
<s> jazz emerged from this merger of forms </s>
<s> full circle  but as to who actually invented jazz if such an achievement could be attributed to one person thats a tricky matter </s>
<s> some say elvis presley or chuck berry invented rock n roll others would argue dj kool herc or grandmaster flash created hip hop </s>
<s> nick la rocca the original dixieland jass bands cornet player and composer claimed that he personally invented jazz  though the cornetist buddy bolden had a much better claim or even the creole artist morton who certainly was the first to write jazz out as sheet music and always said hed invented it </s>
<s> as jazz historian gary giddins puts it larocca turned racist and proceeded to make horrible statements about how whites invented jazz and how they were there before the black guys and so forth scurrilous stuff  a cartoon cliché of the southern bigot </s>
<s> louis armstrong was more charitable in his 1936 book swing that music calling the original dixieland jass band the first great jazz orchestra and that larocca had an instrumentation different from anything before an instrumentation that made the old songs sound new </s>
<s> but laroccas later statements follow a long tradition in the us of white artists dependent on africanamerican culture publicly degrading it in order to justify their exploitation of it </s>
<s> ts not only the racism and the cultural appropriation that makes even dixieland jazz aficionados uncomfortable with the original dixieland jass band  its the bad taste of it all too laroccas inflammatory comments yes but also the silliness of the animal sounds the musicians imitate in their performances their lack of technical proficiency the association of their sound with minstrelsy </s>
<s> but the loudest voices who declare this is not jazz about any particular band or sound are usually jazz obsessives splitting musical hairs that only the infatuated would care about </s>
<s> its an internal civil war </s>
<s> jazz as a whole also came under attack as an example of bad taste however in much the same way rock n roll and hiphop would later by people who had no knowledge of the music whatsoever </s>

<s> and edward baxter perry wrote in the popular music magazine the etude that ragtime into which he was lumping early jazz songs like livery stable blues and the original dixieland jass bands even more popular 1917 followup tiger rag is syncopation gone mad </s>

<s> and we do know a lot about him </s>

<s> by clemency burtonhill   10 january 2017  is it ever too late to learn a musical instrument </s>
<s> according to the leading british concert pianist james rhodes the answer is an emphatic no  and he has just written the book to prove it </s>
<s> the delightfully straighttalking how to play the piano is an elegant little volume that promises  with just 45 minutes practice a day six days a week for six weeks  to enable anyone with access to a keyboard to play one of js bachs most beloved works the prelude no 1 in c major from book one of the welltempered clavier </s>
<s> the book rhodes reveals came from an overwhelming response to his excoriating 2015 memoir instrumental which addressed his devastating mental breakdown and the critical role music played in his recovery and redemption </s>
<s> following its publication countless readers were moved to tell him theyd been inspired by his words to return to the piano themselves </s>
<s> i lose track of how many people have said oh i used to play when i was a kid i wish id stuck it out he tells me mentioning one particular email that sparked the idea </s>
<s> i got a message from a retired mexican professional airline pilot who said i used to play as a kid but i havent played for 50 years </s>
<s> i read instrumental i bought a piano i got myself a piano teacher now i practise every day </s>
<s> and i just want you to know these are my best days </s>
<s>  i found that so moving </s>
<s> rhodes new book is the first in publisher quercus books little book of life skills series </s>
<s> it manages to tap into something pervasive even romantic in the western zeitgeist  becoming better more skilled more cultured and accomplished versions of ourselves  whilst never deviating from the integrity of a tradition that has remained essentially unchanged since humans first started making music on keyboards hundreds of years ago </s>
<s> learning a musical instrument can unlock the door to a new dimension that many of us have forgotten even exists rhodes begins in his opening chapter and there is no denying the immense appeal of laying aside technology to engage ones fingers and brain and soul in a pursuit that has nothing to do with email texting or social media </s>
<s> his project offers perhaps the ultimate digital detox </s>
<s> reading the book i had fantasies of lighting a few candles of an evening pouring a large glass of wine and getting stuck in to my piano practice an alluring act of hygge artistic selfimprovement and selfcare all in one </s>
<s> if youd told me as a kid that id one day actually look forward to practising the piano i would have laughed in disbelief </s>
<s> but in rhodes witty engaging unpretentious hands the prospect of daily pianopractice and its requirement of deep concentration becomes both meditation and medication </s>
<s> we live in an age of such instant gratification were always looking outside of ourselves and i think weve lost sight of just doing something quiet for ourselves he offers when i suggest that the book is also a timely reflection of a modern western aspiration not to material wealth but to spiritual and emotional enrichment as seen in the proliferation of on and offline adult skills courses such as those offered by skillshare creative live and the school of life </s>
<s> not for the reward but just for the sheer loveliness of doing it </s>
<s> i think of playing the piano as a version of mindfulness  for which you dont need a fleet of commandostyle shavenhaired monks you just need a keyboard </s>
<s> besides have we ever needed analogue escape routes more than now </s>
<s> rhodes agrees </s>
<s> all the news is bad so why not just do something lovely for ourselves </s>
<s>   ditch the scales  besides learning  or relearning  a skill such as playing the piano is proven to be good for our brains </s>
<s> according to research from the university of texas mentallychallenging leisure activities can rewire our grey matter restoring our brains to a more youthlike state </s>
<s> rhodes is careful not to overpromise </s>
<s> look this book wont have you playing rachmaninov or chopin etudes </s>
<s> i was well aware that if you set out with a book about learning to play the piano and you say it takes 10000 hours nobodys going to do it because for whatever reason good or bad it has become hard to find time to simply focus and work on something for yourself </s>
<s> time is such a precious commodity </s>
<s> but it will have you playing some bach </s>
<s> and the bach is still challenging it will still push you but its as accessible as possible </s>
<s> he continues </s>
<s> and six weeks is an outsize estimate if you have time to practise more or you played a lot as a kid it will come back quicker </s>
<s> and it will give you a proper insight into the music </s>
<s> maybe that in itself will be enough or maybe youll enjoy it so much youll decide to get a teacher and learn other things </s>
<s> central to his approach is the beauty of the actual music itself </s>
<s> im a big fan of taking a piece that you want to play and finding a positive way to work at it not through scales and etudes and exercises but by simply playing it he explains </s>
<s> the book breaks down exactly how to practise in this way including his genius fingerings which staves off the potential boredom and frustration that would lead many of us to give up </s>
<s> i tell him i could never face doing scales and arpeggios as a child and i feel no differently about them as an adult </s>
<s> arpeggios and scales are never necessary </s>
<s>  he insists </s>
<s> in any piece there will be technical challenges that you can work on using the music itself </s>
<s> i also loathe doing scales and arpeggios but hey im looking at this mozart concerto thats sitting on my piano right now and its filled with scales and arpeggios </s>
<s> if youre working on a piece and achieving something its a great way to learn </s>
<s> find a piece you love and work on it through the music </s>
<s> rhodes is evangelical about the joys of connecting or reconnecting with the piano and beyond the book itself his website has tutorials and videos dedicated to help you on your journey </s>

<s> by fraser mcalpine   27 october 2016  the factors that combine to create a worldbeating album are often whispersoft tissuethin and impossible to recapture </s>
<s> talent plays a key role but so does timing judgment and a great deal of good luck </s>
<s> in the case of amy winehouses back to black released 10 years ago today the talent was undeniable but her personal judgement was questionable even when her artistic decisions were beyond reproach her perfect timing was ultimately a mixed blessing and whatever luck surrounded her quickly flipflopped from bad to good and then back again with renewed vigour </s>
<s> the autobiographical stuff has been raked over enough a girl met a boy </s>
<s> he was in a relationship he didnt want to end but the attraction between them was too strong to overcome </s>
<s> his ambivalence fuelled her easily triggered feelings of low selfesteem from which the only escape was to drink or take drugs until something felt different </s>
<s> back to black   this lead to a series of bleak drunken episodes and ultimately some kind of intervention in which friends and family tried to encourage her to look after herself </s>
<s> deep in the throes of addiction and with the skills of denial developed from a lifetime hiding an eating disorder she bullishly insisted she was fine while desperately throwing everything utterly everything into the lyrics for her new album as her sole salvation </s>
<s> its at this point the talent takes over </s>
<s> the 11 songs amy winehouse wrote for back to black are a poetic response to chaotic feelings </s>
<s> sometimes they are philosophical and poised  as in love is a losing game  sometimes theyre stroppy and tough </s>
<s> her bruised voice makes order out of disorder giving her  and therefore her audience  a feeling of control over heartbreak and a way to deal with some extraordinarily potent emotions by detailing her darkest most grimy actions with a forensic gleeful eye for detail </s>
<s> one listen to you know im no good is enough to put anyone further into the picture than they may wish to venture </s>
<s> and that truelife detail is one of the key factors fuelling the success of the album </s>
<s> while amy was a colossal jazz soul and gospel fan using the emotive heft of the music of the early 20th century as the stylistic base for her own songwriting her lyrics were inspired by the brutal honesty and toughness of hip hop </s>
<s> its an influence she was more than happy to let show especially in me  mr jones with references to slick rick and nas and using flowery profanity that never troubled the song sheets of ella fitzgerald or billie holiday </s>
<s> black and blues  another key factor and a slightly more contentious one is the sumptuousness of the arrangements </s>
<s> both mark ronson and salaam remi sought to place amys words into plush musical backing </s>
<s> while ronsons focus was to create a fullscale motown revue bringing in the dapkings to create arrangements based on those used in records by the supremes and the temptations  particularly in back to black  remi drew from a slightly broader pool of black music for inspiration </s>
<s> while his tears dry on their own is cut from a similar cloth he also provided the torch song backwash for some unholy war and the twinkling lovers rock for just friends </s>
<s> it could be argued that this sweetening detracted from the songs meanings burying the poetry and truth of amys words under a gloss of immaculately rendered retrosoul rather than sharpening up all of her raw edges </s>
<s> but its worth noting that the sampling or fastidious recreation of the sound of old records to make new ones fitted perfectly with amys love of both hip hop and classic soul </s>
<s> it gave her musical armour </s>
<s> the cornerstone of this approach was rehab the albums first single and the song which ensured that amy winehouse would remain a media sensation for the rest of her life </s>
<s> its a song as a perfect moment the glorious cussedness of a cornered ray charles reborn in the mouth of a frustrated heartbroken woman from london </s>
<s> and despite that song generating a million cheap jibes against its own singer in the months to come its power lies in both the rebellious twofingered salute of the moment she wrote it and the ruthless commercial exploitation of her personal life that immediately followed </s>
<s> just before the moment of inspiration struck mark ronson had been talking to her about an attempt her dad made to get her to deal with her alcoholic blackouts </s>
<s> in a later interview with bbc radio 1 mark revealed that she had said he tried to make me go to rehab and i was like pfft no no no </s>
<s>  immediately hearing the song blossom in his head and recognising this made him a poor friend but a great producer </s>
<s> i mean im supposed to be like how was that for you </s>
<s>  and all im like is weve got to go back to the studio </s>
<s>  honesty was aided by artistry and the amy winehouse theme song was born for better and worse </s>
<s> thats one of the key reasons back to black stands alone next to almost every other album released in 2006 </s>
<s> plenty of artists were exploring dusty old jazz ballads or retro soul and a good deal of them would happily lay claim to be writing honest songs </s>
<s> adele would soon come along and take over the world with a similarly winning mix of rhythm and blues and romantic damnation leaving joss stone and duffy wondering what she has that they dont </s>
<s> but very few of them were living a life as extreme as amys and still fewer would have admitted every unflattering bruise and blemish artfully or otherwise </s>
<s> maybe they couldve written a tears dry on their own but only amy winehouse could have written a song as selflacerating or vulnerable as back to black all the while packing her romantic suicide note with bitter wisdom and hardboiled wit </s>
<s> theres an argument that this honesty was just a smokescreen a way of hiding a worse truth in plain sight under a barrage of grotty reportage </s>
<s> yes she was heartbroken yes she was drunk yes she had some leftover issues from her childhood and yes she was capable of extreme behaviour but while she does mention her lover her boozing her drug use her various push n pull escapades and even her dad in song there are no amy winehouse lyrics about food or eating disorders and that has to be a deliberate choice on her part </s>
<s> but even without that hidden narrative as an album back to black speaks to so many people because we all share the interior monologue that were grotesque and unworthy of good fortune </s>
<s> even without having experienced a fraction of the things listed in the albums lyric sheet we all carry the suspicion that we are messy flawed individuals who feel like we cant do right for doing wrong </s>
<s> if love is a losing game what we all need is the advice of someone who has gone for broke gambled everything they had and lost </s>

<s> before no matter what wed have done whether you wanted to go to the opera or not in linz it was so impenetrable </s>
<s> then we took the road away and its front door became the volksgarten the peoples park </s>
<s> and it went from being extraordinarily difficult to access to being easier to approach than a normal building </s>
<s> access all areas  as a comment on that endlessly circular vexed debate about the accessibility of opera pawsons futuristic lightsuffused structure represents an opening up that goes gloriously beyond metaphor </s>
<s> and in an era in which we are far more likely to witness the construction of a new shopping centre than an opera house the latter event is especially to be cheered </s>
<s> the building in question is not only one of dazzling architectural vision and environmental innovation but a space that inventively presents opera and its relationship to the urban and social environment in a new light </s>
<s> no wonder the worlds bestknown contemporary classical composer wanted to write the work that would inaugurate it </s>
<s> it is much more than just a beautiful building philip glass enthuses from his home in manhattans east village </s>
<s> it actually embraces the idea that the opera house is part of the social context </s>
<s> glass who has lately worked with the likes of david bowie leonard cohen and woody allen spent a year searching for the right work with which to open the house finally settling upon an adaptation of an austrian play by peter handke which he has called the lost </s>
<s> handkes play is about everything really glass explains </s>
<s> when i came across it i was struck by its theatricality </s>
<s> there is a protagonist and a chorus and there are people that function as actors also which is very important </s>
<s> one of the challenges we had was how to include in the opening piece artists from all the disciplines that would be at the new opera house which will also house theatre and ballet companies </s>
<s> the extraordinarily prolific glass who has recently celebrated his 76th birthday is hardly cowed by such challenges </s>
<s> in my 70s im working from a different place he confides with a chuckle </s>
<s> when i began i was basically learning on the job </s>
<s> you dont study opera composing at the conservatory you get yourself in to the theatre and you get working </s>
<s> ive done a few operas now  the lost is his twentyninth  and i have quite a lot of experience with orchestration and singers </s>
<s> a big statement  for the lost which will play in repertory until july and then again in the 201415 season glass says he has employed the orchestra and chorus in different ways </s>
<s> sometimes there are a people in the pit sometimes theyre on the stage they move back and forth </s>
<s> from a theatrical point of view probably the only place you could do this piece is the opera house where you have that range of instrumentation and vocalization and expression </s>
<s> opera lends itself to that to big statements with a lot of variety </s>
<s> variety certainly seems to be a linz watchword </s>
<s> shortly before opening night dennis russell davies glass longtime collaborator and music director at the new house tells me with pride that operatically all eyes will be in this direction for a while </s>
<s> but he is equally quick to point out that in addition to the glass premiere  which would be a huge event for any opera house anywhere  the first four days of the opening season also encompass a musical version of the witches of eastwick a ballet and richard strausss opera der rosenkavalier </s>

<s> by miranda sawyer 2 may 2013 the music business like many businesses is shrinking </s>
<s> jobs that were once vital are deemed extraneous every artist does everything for themselves whether thats booking the gigs doing the pr or finding the audience </s>
<s> and of course recording their own album </s>
<s> who needs a producer when you can do the whole thing yourself on your laptop in the comfort of your own bedroom </s>
<s> what does a producer bring to music </s>
<s> no one knows what a producer does says ben hillier who happens to be a highly respected one hes worked on albums by depeche mode elbow blur and the horrors </s>
<s> thats because you can do the job in lots of different ways from recording everything helping write the songs playing the instruments to just setting the band up with good assistants and engineers and walking off to have a long lunch </s>
<s> dan carey has produced artists as varied as bat for lashes lily allen the kills and kylie minogue </s>
<s> how do i do the job </s>
<s> that depends </s>
<s> with acoustic or indie bands i might turn all the lights off put on a smoke machine and a laser just to get them to play in a different way </s>
<s> its a lot to do with the experience of playing a feeling that produces a sound </s>
<s> production line  in times past such techniques never fell under scrutiny </s>
<s> bands used to hole up with a producer for a few months often at a residential studio and be left to their own devices  and vices  until they came up with an album </s>
<s> the classic example is the two and half years two studios and three producers it took for the stone roses to record second coming </s>
<s> but in these busier more pennypinching days thats rare </s>
<s> instead an artist will work with a producer for a week or ten days before being snatched away to go on tour or do promotion </s>
<s> a month or so later theyll come back </s>
<s> ive made albums in a fortnight says carey </s>
<s> no one wants to pay for weeks and weeks of studio time any more </s>
<s> you cant mess about you have to decide what youre doing do it and its done </s>
<s> but shorter working periods mean less time for band and producer to get into the zone that special space where surprises happen and true creativity can fly </s>
<s> its hard to be truly experimental on a timeisticking shift </s>
<s> added to which jumpy record companies will now demand to hear tracks long before theyre finished  which says hillier can be a disaster </s>
<s> the biggest fear in a record company is a failure and people have a remarkably narrow imagination </s>
<s> if someone hears an unfinished but really exciting idea a rough mix theyll say hmm not enough bass drum </s>
<s> and that kills confidence which is what music is all about </s>
<s> in the 80s and 90s there would be an ar artists and repertoire department to protect the band from such interference </s>
<s> ar men  they usually were men  were big characters minderscomeprs who got the artist and sold the idea of their album within the record company before it had even been finished </s>
<s> now says hillier the producer has to do that </s>
<s> you have to cue up a track explain why its exciting whats so amazing about it before you play it </s>
<s> if you do that then it will always get a better reception </s>
<s> multitasking musicians  these days artists can sell themselves if needed </s>
<s> they can fight their own fights </s>
<s> and they can certainly create their own sound </s>
<s> demos those scratchy tapes of scrappy acoustic ideas are almost dead especially for artists who make electronic music </s>
<s> you dont need to make a demo when you can produce the whole thing yourself </s>
<s> carey acknowledges that many electronic artists turn up to work with a nearfinished piece of music on their laptop </s>
<s> they want you to redo it properly but you have to be careful he says </s>
<s> you might kill whats brilliant about it </s>
<s> often he says a producers help is needed for the vocals  they need rerecording  or to take out the more generic sounds that come from producing on computer software </s>
<s> they might not know that theres been about ten other records that have just come out that week that use exactly that sound </s>
<s> and hillier points out that with a first album a musician has the luxury of time </s>
<s> an artist can sit at their laptop with a mate and work up a notgreat recording into something amazing through postproduction he says </s>
<s> but with the second album they wont have that </s>
<s> they hit a brick wall because their mate doesnt know how to get the sound they want when theres only a few hours to get it down </s>
<s> so it seems the record producer is not out of a job just yet </s>
<s> and unlikely to be so even if there is less money to spend </s>
<s> artists are strange characters happy to noodle and experiment until the cows come home and the audience moves on </s>
<s> bands are an ongoing argument usually between the singer and the guitarist </s>
<s> a producer is the person who makes sure that the band is arguing about their music rather than their girlfriends </s>
<s> a producer stops the jamming and says do that bit again </s>
<s> a producer keeps the suits away until theyre absolutely necessary </s>

<s> no doubt there are some in the purist classical world who will view the announcement as a cynical attempt to lure audiences who wouldnt usually be seen dead at an opera house </s>

<s> hongs successful 2009 production of paulo coelhos bestseller the alchemist was hailed by the new york times as mahlerian </s>
<s> more recently he has been conducting such 20th century operatic classics as brittens peter grimes and richard strauss elektra and salomé </s>
<s> hong if refreshingly unpretentious is no musical lightweight </s>
<s> so why does he want to give breaking bad the operatic treatment </s>
<s> meth and metronomes  like many traditional operas hong said from new york breaking bad explores crises of deep human emotion during tremendous pressures or repression whether they are social economical political or spiritual </s>
<s> the audience is intensely involved in the narrative and heavily invested in the transforming characters and complex plot </s>
<s> that transformation is key he likens walter whites genesis into heisenberg to similar transitions in the aforementioned operas </s>
<s> the main characters in grimes elektra and salomé slowly transform from protagonist to antagonistin all these noir narratives the seeds are carefully planted in advance and when they are strategically harvested the fruits go far beyond our expectation </s>
<s> that strategic harvest of narrative and character potentially makes breaking bad the perfect operatic subject </s>
<s> the beautiful thing about opera is it allows you to stop time to examine moments and the import of one moment against another in a nonchronological way said opera director and tenor andrew staples who has recently sung at the royal opera house covent garden and whose own productions challenge received notions of how to present canonical opera </s>
<s> breaking bad achieves that too sometimes a whole episode is about one idea or the plot is so twisted you spend time unpacking what it actually means for each character </s>
<s> this ability to examine the same situation from multiple character angles is a very operatic a very mozartian device </s>
<s> opera of the masses  hongs breaking badozymandias can be viewed in the context of a trend in opera to lean on the potential appeal of contemporary subjects </s>
<s> ten years ago there was jerry springer the opera and then in 2011 the royal opera house in london blew a large portion of its seasonal budget with anna nicole based on the tragic life of playboy playmate and reality tv star anna nicole smith </s>

<s> his music has proved to be of inestimable use not just in the local communities he cared so passionately about but in the big wide world beyond </s>

<s>  he himself was relaxed in admitting his own indebtedness to the past apparently untroubled by the psychological anxiety of influence that plagued his more avantgardist contemporaries </s>

<s> as well as his significant contributions to any genre you could care to name in 1945 he singlehandedly revived major english opera with peter grimes while also inventing the concept of pocket opera without britten there would not only have been no such works as lennox berkeleys a dinner engagement or william waltons the bear but probably no english touring opera no mid wales opera no pavilion opera </s>
<s> brittens powerful operatic message was this get it out there make it useful let the local community know it is theirs  most heroically of all and with a commitment perhaps matched only by leonard bernstein britten was determined to make music more accessible to children   opening their eyes and ears to the joys of classical musicmaking in works such as the young persons guide to the orchestra the little sweep and noyes fludde </s>

<s> that choice in itself is telling lang is a pulitzeraward winning composer whose astonishing soundworld is about as far from the comforting familiarity of the core cello repertoire as you can get </s>
<s> lang has called his concerto world to come and beiser tells me it is an incarnation of a multitrack solo cello piece that he previously wrote for her carnegie hall debut </s>
<s> the piece is extraordinary she says pulsating with constantly changing uneven metre and heartbreaking in its beauty </s>
<s> given her background its perhaps no surprise that beiser brings a different attitude to her musicmaking than the average classical artist </s>
<s> born to a french mother and argentine father she was raised on an israeli kibbutz in the galilee that had a profound influence on her </s>
<s> it was a selfsustaining commune farm with great idealism about changing the world she reveals </s>
<s> music and art were an essential part of the progressive education </s>
<s> human voice  her father used to play her old recordings of the great cellist pablo casals inspiring a lifelong love affair with the deep humanlike quality of the instruments sound </s>
<s> but my father also taught me to think critically and not to take anything for granted beiser recalls </s>
<s> he was close friends with many arab bedouins in the villages that surrounded the kibbutz </s>
<s> i was enchanted by their generosity and hospitality </s>
<s> she conjures up a captivating soundtrack of childhood musical memories of early mornings practicing the bach solo cello suites while the sound of the muezzin the muslim call to prayer from the nearby arab village crept through the window overlooking the jordan valley </s>
<s> in the afternoon my parents would play the music of astor piazzolla and carlos gardel </s>
<s> i learned to embrace all these different types of music as one as art as profound human expression </s>
<s> this video is no longer available  this video is no longer available since graduating from the esteemed yale university school of music beiser has remained true to that philosophy unflinchingly embracing different influences and approaches </s>
<s> i never felt connected to the rules that were created in classical music performances about how to behave and how to dress or even how to play a particular phrase she says </s>
<s> i am attracted to many kinds of music  and a lot which is not even played on the cello </s>
<s> and ive always been interested in the creation of something new </s>
<s> not to belittle the reinterpretation of the old masters but i wanted to be involved in the creative process on many levels </s>

<s> beiser has become synonymous with music performances that consciously  but without gimmickry  shake up and explode the whole notion of what a classical concert might be complete with technology and visuals that furnish meaningful connections with other disciplines such as design and neuroscience </s>
<s> one of the reasons i am so interested in technology is that it allows me to dream big she explains </s>
<s> i feel so lucky that we have such advanced technology now that i can incorporate it into my performances in seamless ways </s>
<s> i love the interplay between the energy that happens live on stage and the technological elements that allow me to expand my vocabulary in so many different directions </s>
<s> but i never want to lose that human intimate thread </s>

<s> ioulex credit ioulex ioulex i recently had a conversation with a brilliant neuroscientist who talked about the evolution of music in our civilisation she responds </s>
<s> you know its only relatively recently that music performance became separated from music composition and the performer separated from the audience </s>
<s> for thousands of years humans created and performed music simultaneously  singing dancing and moving with its beat </s>
<s> and it appears that when our brain processes music it makes us want to move </s>
<s> it is not natural to sit still in a hall surrounded with other people who are silent and motionless </s>
<s> so one of the reasons that people respond to rock n roll or pop music is not so much the music itself but the fact that they are allowed to feel it in their bodies </s>
<s> they can express themselves  scream or cry or dance or sing along </s>
<s> we need to free up the classical concert environment </s>
<s> that would go a long way to get the audience back </s>
<s> for beiser theres an urgent and humane reason why this matters </s>
<s> in our intense global overstimulated society i love the fact that music allows us to go to places that are far away from the here and now from the mundane she observes </s>

<s> on 11 june 1964 celebrations to mark the strauss centenary were notably muted </s>
<s> despite being cleared by a german denazification board in june 1948 his music still carried a stigma </s>

<s> art over politics </s>
<s> all this suggests strauss rather complex legacy  this was a man who was president of hitlers reichsmusikkammer reich music chamber yet watched the persecution of his beloved jewish daughterinlaw and family in horror  has finally settled around what is arguably the only incontrovertible fact that of his musical and dramatic genius </s>
<s> where the debate around wagners antisemitism and his music still rumbles on strauss has been largely exonerated in the popular as well as official historical imagination </s>
<s> as the music critic michael kennedy makes clear in his masterful biography richard strauss man musician enigma after hitler came to power in january 1933 strauss faced a moral and professional quandary as did all professional musicians in germany at the time </s>
<s> he was ambitious and rather selfregarding but above all he was a pragmatist </s>
<s> i made music under the kaiser he supposedly told his family </s>
<s> ill survive under this lot as well </s>

<s> everything else is irrelevant to me </s>

<s> i hoped that i would be able to do some good and prevent worse misfortunes he said later </s>
<s> while his chief objective seemed to be improving the economic position of musicians increasing their job security ensuring more government subsidy and in particular protecting the rights of composers  he lobbied hard for germany to sign the berne convention on copyright law  he also refused to blacklist jewish composers and remained publicly loyal to his jewish friends and colleagues who were falling foul of the aryanizing nazi authorities  most notably the austrianjewish writer stefan zweig who wrote the libretto for his opera die schweigsame frau the silent woman in 1934 </s>
<s> it was indeed a letter from strauss to zweig that led to strauss forced resignation from the reichsmusikkammer and his official downfall </s>
<s> hinting that his position as president was merely a form of playacting the letter was intercepted by the gestapo in june 1935 strauss was out on his ear and the opera was never again performed in nazi germany </s>
<s> in one of his more shameful episodes strauss backpedalled furiously writing to hitler to assure him that his missive to zweig had not represented my view of the world nor my true conviction </s>
<s> hitler never replied </s>
<s> under pressure  such pandering to nazi top brass must have been galling for the man who in his private notebooks wrote i consider the jewbaiting by goebbels a disgrace to german honour </s>
<s> goebbels for his part called strauss a decadent neurotic behind the scenes </s>
<s>  nor did the nazi menace remain something abstract to strauss  on the contrary he was personally touched by its evil </s>
<s> he was deeply fond of his jewish daughterinlaw alice and his jewish grandchildren and was aghast when alice was arrested towards the end of world war ii </s>
<s> although she was released members of her immediate family were deported to terezín in what is now the czech republic and when strauss letters begging for their release fell on deaf ears the composer personally drove to the camp in an attempt to use his influence to get them released </s>
<s> it was futile not a single one escaped the nazi concentration camp alive </s>
<s> there are no easy answers when it comes to the question of art biography and morality and the line between resistance passivity and collaboration in nazi germany is arguably the murkiest of all </s>

<s> to his musical eye they seemed remarkably similar to the notation and design of a musical score and the idea was born to create a musical structure that could actually incorporate bernies recordings within a symphony orchestra </s>

<s> rather than just spotlighting certain trophy sounds i worked hard to try to create music that genuinely came out of the natural soundscapes </s>
<s>  he spent two years working on the symphony to create what he describes as the musical texture created by the layered songs and noises of many creatures in a rich natural environment such as a rainforest animals may be at play for purposes of mating communication or just high spirits and so my musical riffs tried to capture some of that exuberance </s>
<s> in the fourth movement for example i liked the idea of the massive but mostly gentle power of the african elephant herd </s>
<s> so i asked the whole orchestra to play a sustained passage pianissimo rather like driving a ferrari at 20 mph a thing of enormous potential power but just ticking over </s>
<s> born to be wild  the symphony also reflects an anthropological reality  one that we forget at our peril </s>
<s> for as krause points out our impulse to language to make music to dance and to sing derives directly from the animal habitats we once were part of too </s>
<s> the idea that animals taught humans to dance and sing is not a philosophical question nor is it new insists krause </s>
<s> for it is from the collective and structured animal voices that came from habitats we once lived in that we picked out and imitated the rhythms melodies textures and organisation of sound </s>
<s> thats because were mimics </s>
<s> therefore when we lived more closely connected to the natural world we integrated these natural gifts into our musical expression which in turn evolved into language </s>
<s> for krause there is much at stake </s>
<s> ive been recording for nearly five decades now he points out </s>
<s> whats so shocking to me is that fully 50 of my archive  and its a large one  comes from habitats so transformed by human endeavour that theyre either altogether depleted of wildlife sound or the soundscape is so radically altered that the biophonies can no longer be heard in any of their original form </s>
<s> when i ask him what he hopes audiences will take away from the experience of the great animal orchestra he adds i just hope that folks young and old will realise what a great and inspirational gift weve all be given with these wild soundscapes </s>

<s> all music </s>
<s> humanity and divinity  bachs instinctive understanding of human nature his rhetorical skills and his innate skill as a dramatist are second to none </s>
<s> living from 1685 to 1750 he had no choice but to write music to the glory of god  and yet everything that it is to be human  to love to lose to laugh to be betrayed to betray to be torn into little pieces or to feel so whole you could fly is here </s>
<s> conflict friendship despair joy his music encompasses what i can only describe as the everythingness of everything </s>
<s> even shakespeare cannot compare </s>
<s> john eliot gardiner a peerless bach conductor and author of the superb recent biography music in the castle of heaven jokes that bach is like snorkelling </s>
<s> being in bachs music has that sense of otherness its another world we enter as performers or listeners he told me in a recent interview </s>
<s> you put your mask on and you go down to a psychedelic world of myriad colours </s>
<s> gardiner also makes a compelling point about bachs music and faith </s>
<s> because when you hear something that beautiful its hard not to wonder how it could have been made by a mere mortal </s>
<s> gardiner is an agnostic but admits to feeling close to becoming a christian when performing bach </s>
<s> its irresistible in its persuasiveness he admits </s>
<s> i cannot deny that even if my logical mind says no  my soul my spirit says this can only have come from somebody who has a totally credible and believable sense of godhead and the futility of human existence these are the aspirations that are necessary to make sense of our lives  bachs music was made through faith but it transcends faith </s>
<s> he humanises the lutheran theology of his time and makes it approachable </s>
<s> he makes it speak to people of all beliefs and of none </s>
<s> gardiner reckons bachs own tussles with faith explored through the music make his sacred pieces less didactic less doctrinaire than others </s>
<s> consider for example the peasant stomp of the b minor mass as opposed to handels wispy angels which disappear into the ether </s>
<s> this earthy element to bachs epic spirituality is a wonderful paradox </s>
<s> there is so much wit </s>
<s> its real </s>
<s> bach suffered devastating personal loss and his music while occasionally saturated in grief is somehow always immensely consoling </s>
<s> this is particularly true of his two hundredodd cantatas an astonishing suite of works that form the centre of his musical universe </s>
<s> as soprano nancy argenta has said bach can be very reassuring </s>
<s> when youre feeling frazzled you need bach not beethoven to relax you </s>
<s> he has a calmness that makes people feel that alls well with the world and that theyll be all right </s>
<s> the first rock star </s>
<s> helmuth rilling another outstanding bach conductor reckons the true extent of bachs genius is only now becoming apparent </s>
<s> when asked by gramophone magazine if bach was best he had this to say he was the great consolidator summing up the best of what had gone before refining the best ideas of his own time </s>
<s> and its not enough simply to look at bachs achievements alone </s>
<s> hes the teacher par excellence rilling says </s>

<s> the film focuses on the 196667 years when hendrix came to london and was discovered by britains rock royalty including paul mccartney eric clapton and jeff beck </s>

<s> to hear the history books tell it that albums arrival was akin to tectonic plates shifting the earth moving beneath a cultures feet </s>
<s> we are told that theres guitar before hendrix and theres guitar after hendrix </s>
<s> few rock instrumentalists get treated so reverently and fewer still created their own aura and era so definitively for all time </s>
<s> it didnt hurt that hendrix died in 1970 only three years after his arrival as a seemingly instant rock star </s>
<s> all this from a man who spoke softly and did not appear to be outwardly driven by what the music business had to offer </s>
<s> yet on voodoo chile one of his most esteemed tracks hendrix channels some of the hightestosterone mythmaking of one of his idols muddy waters when he declares well the night i was bornlord i swear the moon turned a fire red </s>
<s> im pretty sure the moon didnt turn a fire red on 27 november 1942 and its certain hendrix knew his mythical powers werent created by cosmic events but by notsomythical virtues such as intense listening astute taste and heavy road work </s>
<s> call it a combination of blood sweat and brains but hendrix was less an instant sensation than a student who through intensive training and innate talent transcended his many teachers </s>
<s> all those who buy into the halleys comet myth do hendrix and his work ethic a disservice </s>

<s> he worked with the isley brothers  who wouldnt have their biggest hits until years later  and little richard who was trying to mount a rock n roll comeback after years in gospel exile and he learned how to drive a band and deliver a song economically and efficiently </s>
<s> meanwhile he was absorbing the innovations of guitarists ranging from buddy guy to les paul </s>

<s> in the hands of guy or bo diddley the guitar was a sound machine rather than an instrument with a prescribed vocabulary </s>
<s> hendrix saw the possibilities outside the rulebook margins and unlike guy found a band manager and record company who let him wander into the wild fearlessly </s>
<s> he left behind hundreds of tracks and works in progress while recording a handful of officially released studio albums a testament to how much he loved to explore and how difficult he was to please </s>

<s> jimmy jam chairman emeritus of the recording academy told cnn that lorde essentially got snubbed because she fits the new artist category almost too well </s>
<s> she is still very new he said </s>
<s> sometimes i think the grammy voters like to say well lets see what else you have before we say youre the best new artist </s>
<s>   mr jam is responsible for some of the greatest pop and rb hits ever recorded but thats absurd </s>
<s> as pop rabblerouser lily allen noted in taking issue with that logic calling them shammys lorde wont be a new artist anymore if she has to make more records to prove her staying power </s>

<s> thats pretty good company </s>
<s> though no masterpiece pure heroine establishes a voice that testifies about what it means to be part of a generation that is relentlessly solicited constantly connected and prematurely cynical </s>
<s> its a canny pop construct with royals as exhibit a a song that pokes fun at materialism even as it namechecks the products the narrator claims not to care about </s>
<s> it allows lorde to have it both ways </s>
<s> so too with the best new artist category </s>
<s> she may have been snubbed for one big honour but her song and record of the year nominations are still likely to resonate at the sales counter for weeks afterward </s>
<s> its just a wild guess but the rolling stones recent run of paydays er concerts are not likely to have gone unnoticed by the former members of led zeppelin </s>

<s> but the reunion proved to be a oneoff largely because plant wanted no part of doing something more despite tour offers ranging as high as 200m 132m from concert promoters </s>
<s> page and jones even started working with other vocalists in plants stead in hope of keeping zeppelin afloat but never took it beyond the rehearsal stage </s>
<s> plant instead focused on touring in 2008 with country singer alison krauss and producer t bone burnett with whom he made a grammywinning album raising sand </s>

<s> engage plant more deeply on the subject of what it means to play music and hell tell you its all about discovery new challenges </s>
<s> he sees a zeppelin reunion as a nostalgia piece fired by youth and a different kind of exuberance as he once said </s>
<s> part of his response suggests that it would be difficult to do anything zeprelated on his terms that is to create and perform new music rather than rely on rehashing the past </s>
<s> even if plant page and jones reunited to make a new album would fans want to hear them play it in concert at the expense of whole lotta love and stairway to heaven </s>

<s> thirty years ago this september tina turners wait was over </s>
<s> she finally had a number one single with whats love got to do with it </s>
<s> after a bitter breakup with her husband ike in the 1970s turner had established herself as a solo artist to be reckoned with </s>
<s> she also happened to be 44 years old  at the time the oldest female artist to go to the top of the charts </s>
<s> back then it wasnt that unusual for a veteran artist to score a huge pop single </s>
<s> a year later grace slick also 44 at the time had a hit with starships we built this city and in 1999 the ageless cher was 53 when believe launched her comeback </s>
<s> but in the last decade stories like turners are becoming less frequent </s>
<s> heritage artists who havent retired or faded away have to rely more than ever on past hits to sustain tours and maintain careers because the pop charts are dominated by increasingly younger performers 17yearold lorde and 22yearold sam smith are the norm </s>
<s> pop stardom has always been a young persons game but never more so than now </s>
<s> what changed </s>
<s> how did veteran acts manage to maintain pop relevance in previous eras </s>
<s> a closer look at some of the more notable examples in past decades shows that these relative oldtimers didnt ignore what was happening in pop culture at the moment but embraced it in a way that for them was authentic and even authoritative </s>
<s> in turners case she got back to the gritty rock persona that had characterised some of her greatest successes with ike turner </s>
<s> after priming audiences by opening tours for rod stewart and the rolling stones she tore into whats love got to do with it like an upstart with something to prove </s>
<s> her sound fit in right alongside top chart acts such a van halen prince and bruce springsteen </s>
<s> a knack for trendhopping enabled the stones to reestablish their place atop the charts with miss you in 1978 a mix of disco faddishness and rock grime </s>
<s> the song went to number one even though mick jagger and the boys were no longer boys but well into their mid and late 30s and bassist bill wyman was 41 </s>
<s> comeback kids  the balancing act between opportunism and integrity kept older artists on the pop charts for decades </s>
<s> diane warren was on a hot streak of powerballad blockbusters in the 90s writing massive hits for leann rimes and celine dion when aerosmith came calling </s>
<s> singer steven tyler was 50 and the bands biggest successes were nearly a decade in the past when the quintet took warrens i dont want to miss a thing to no 1 in 1998 </s>
<s> it also didnt hurt that the song was tied in with a commercially successful hollywood movie armageddon </s>
<s> for hardcore aerosmith fans the song represented a sort of armageddon too but perhaps not in the way the band intended </s>
<s> nonetheless the song effectively reestablished the band with a new audience and kept tyler relevant enough that hed go on to serve as a judge for a couple of years on american idol </s>
<s> in the same year cher came back strong with believe </s>
<s> it made her seem almost hip again with its thundering house beat and autotuned vocals just as dance music was on the ascent around the world </s>
<s> carlos santana at 52 also did some coattail riding on the massive 1999 hit smooth </s>
<s> santana played lead guitar and got his name on the tune but rob thomas of the multimillionselling band matchbox 20 wrote and sang the tune </s>
<s> it was santanas first chart topper ever but likely wouldnt have happened without thomas builtin pop connection </s>
<s> all that changed during the last decade </s>
<s> the pop charts have been virtually a nofly zone for veteran acts  unless they borrow from the santana playbook and collaborate with someone younger and hipper like eminem has </s>
<s> the erstwhile badboy rapper turned 41yearold multimillionaire enlisted rihanna to sing the giant hooks for number one singles love the way you lie and monster </s>
<s> another exception has been 38yearold australian sia whose current top10 hit chandelier bears an uncanny similarity to the vocal style of pop queen beyoncé </s>
<s> radio days  other stars from past eras have not fared as well </s>
<s> onceunstoppable pop juggernauts mariah carey and mary j blige barely got noticed this year when both singers now in their mid40s released new projects </s>
<s> and though veteran rock acts such as pearl jam tom petty eric clapton and bruce springsteen still do well selling albums and concert tickets to their fans they havent been able crack the popsingles chart in decades </s>
<s> why does it matter </s>
<s> because even a modest radio hit can change the arch of a bands career and its public perception as the black keys found out in 2010 when tighten up climbed to a modest number 87 on the pop chart and went gold after receiving tons of commercial radio airplay </s>
<s> it promoted the duo of patrick carney and dan auerbach into an arena band after a decade of playing clubs </s>
<s> everyone told us that there is nothing that will change your career more than getting a record played on radio </s>
<s> carney told me in 2010 </s>
<s> you can make all the great records you want but your audience will stay basically the same </s>
<s> there is a limit to how far you can go without a radio hit </s>
<s> but now that carney and auerbach are in their mid30s they realise the notion of sustaining that kind of pop success becomes less and less likely </s>
<s> ive seen it happen to other bands it blows up and it goes away carney said </s>
<s> i realize there is nothing more special about dan and i that would prevent that from happening especially now </s>
<s> its all propped up by a song on radio and were not a radio band </s>
<s> when bobby womack died a few days ago at the age of 70 another link vanished to a musical tradition that grows more precious and rare with time </s>
<s> soul music as practised by womack and countless peers in the 1950s 60s and 70s arrived as the most tactile variety of the 20th centurys popular music to feel was all </s>
<s> it was bred in the gospel music of the africanamerican churches of the us deep south and the ghettos of northern cities such as chicago cleveland detroit and st louis </s>
<s> gospel music doesnt get the recognition of blues and country as an influence on the rock n roll era but during the 40s it represented the hardest edge of american music with singers pushing the limits of their voices in vocal quartets or organandpiano combos that foreshadowed the rock instrumentation of subsequent decades </s>
<s> in addition the church was something of a sanctuary where africanamericans could most freely express themselves </s>
<s> gospel was the most heightened form of that expression as demonstrated by vocalists and groups such as mahalia jackson sister rosetta tharpe marion williams the soul stirrers and the blind boys of alabama </s>
<s> soul brothers  it was in this tradition that womack emerged </s>
<s> born in 1944 he was singing and performing with his siblings in the womack brothers gospel group by the time he was 10 </s>
<s> the group toured with the staple singers from chicago who were already establishing a groundbreaking sound around pop staples treblesoaked guitar and teenage mavis staples expressive contralto </s>
<s> the womacks were championed by sam cooke who was among the first gospel singers to move into secular music </s>
<s> cooke signed the womack brothers to his sar label in 1960 and rechristened them the valentinos </s>
<s> their sound was essentially unchanged  it still featured the call and response and strident lead vocals of their church days  but they were now singing about secular subjects </s>
<s> bobby womack sang harmonies in the group with his gritty voice and his songwriting talent was a crucial ingredient in the groups success  his its all over now was faithfully covered by the rolling stones and became a uk no 1 pop hit in 1964 </s>
<s> womacks singular style flourished during the 70s and many of his lyrics put a philosophical spin on the daily drama played out on innercity streets and tenements </s>
<s> the temptation and redemption themes of the bible were now played out in domestic scenes every bit as riveting as spiritual stories </s>
<s> as with ray charles and james brown before him and alongside contemporaries such as aretha franklin marvin gaye and donny hathaway he took selfexpression to new levels </s>
<s> it was only appropriate that womacks two foremost albums in the 80s were dubbed the poet and the poet ii </s>
<s> a new church  like gaye stevie wonder al green bill withers ronald isley and other key soul singers of the era womack had created a new church for 70s africanamericans one in which the singer embodied many roles philanderer hustler and outcast but also philosopher and above all preacher </s>
<s> tucked within the soul masterpieces of the day  papa was a rollin stone whats going on fight the power  was a kind of moral code about lines that couldnt be crossed if a relationship to a lover a friend society god was to remain solvent </s>
<s> artists openly struggled with these issues in these vividly written expressively sung tales </s>
<s> its you that i want but its him that i need green sang on the title track of his 1977 masterpiece belle </s>
<s> the message to any listener was clear our souls our direction as human beings is at stake in the everyday decisions we make </s>
<s> but soul music began to fade in popularity amid the rise of disco in the late 70s and though there have been several key practitioners since  including luther vandross mary j blige and dangelo  the connection to the circumstances that led to its creation in the first place barely resonate with new generations of artists and fans </s>
<s> yet womacks latecareer resurrection with the help of damon albarn of blur and gorillaz was no nostalgia act </s>
<s> his albarnproduced 2012 album the bravest man in the universe brought him full circle back to the church music that provided his foundation </s>
<s> he turned the gospel classic jubilee dont let nobody turn you round into a defiant cry against the drugs and illness that haunted the final decades of his life </s>
<s> its too much to ask any contemporary singer to measure up against that sort of performance that oneofakind history that defined artists of a certain generation such as womack cooke brown gaye vandross and others who are now gone </s>
<s> like the urban blues or the hard country artists of that era they will remain as touchstones for new generations to draw inspiration but the circumstances that created them cant be replicated </s>

<s> i gave them access to my songwriting notebooks and it was there they saw the lyric 20000 days as i tried to calculate how many days id spend on the planet </s>
<s> we decided to make a fictitious film about my 20000th day on earth </s>
<s> with its smooth cinematography interviews conducted by a psychoanalyst and occasional soliloquies from cave those who arent fans might label it a vanity project a tag cave and his filmmaking team so much want to avoid </s>
<s> but pollard and forsyth said they were desperate to do something different </s>
<s> we didnt want it to be reverential and we didnt want to unmask him to make him nick cave  ordinary 56yearold singersongwriter adds forsyth </s>
<s> we quickly arrived at this shared understanding with nick that what none of us like about contemporary music documentaries is their presumed unobtrusive observational style </s>
<s> that seeing the real nick cave will somehow reveal something more about nick cave </s>
<s> watching a rock star wash the dishes or taking the kids to school might be interesting on some level but it doesnt intellectually engage you and anyway its been done to death </s>

<s> by clemency burtonhill 21 october 2014 i recently got a phone call from my father in which he said hed decided to clear out his classical record collection </s>
<s> if i was interested i could come over and help myself to anything i wanted </s>
<s> my greedy glee at such a generous invitation had to be tempered by the exigencies of space  unlike him alas i dont have a giant garage in which to store my music  but i still drove home with no fewer than four enormous suitcases stacked full of records mourning the gems id had to leave behind </s>
<s> ive been a vinyl junkie since my teens and consider myself hugely lucky that my job entails going to live concerts on a regular basis </s>
<s> nevertheless like most people in the 21st century much of my musical listening is done through headphones on a small handheld device the quality inevitably impaired </s>
<s> and so it was with a sense of renewed wonder and awe that i sat down to drop the needle on my new hoard </s>
<s> that trove of treasures from albinoni to zemlinsky got me thinking about what it was that makes a truly legendary recording </s>
<s> one of the joys of classical over other musical genres is that the greatest pieces get recorded again and again </s>
<s> and unlike say classic theatrical works which are also repeated and reimagined for each generation so long as the musical performances have been recorded we can continue to experience them in myriad different interpretations </s>
<s> its hard to imagine more compelling proof of musics singular power to connect humanity across time and space than to hear say enrico caruso singing an aria such as una furtiva lagrima in the early 1900s only to follow it with a modern tenor such as joseph calleja singing it over one hundred years later and it moving us in completely different yet resonant ways </s>
<s> with the abundance of recordings out there classical aficionados inevitably spend a lot of time comparing and contrasting performances arguing over definitive recordings </s>
<s> this is mostly an absurd exercise given the vagaries and subjectivities of taste </s>
<s> for most casual listeners moreover the piece itself will be of infinitely more importance than the interpretation so the name on the sleeve is pretty inconsequential </s>
<s> nevertheless certain records do stand out over the years  whether for performance ambition quality of recording or the ground they broke </s>
<s> and when you listen to these records everything stops you can never hear the piece in quite the same way again </s>
<s> so for what its worth here are my entirely personal top ten classical recordings of all time in no particular order </s>
<s> jacqueline du prés elgar cello concerto emi  jackie was just 20 when she recorded the edward elgar cello concerto with conductor sir john barbirolli a conductor with whom she had a unique rapport </s>
<s> her early death from multiple sclerosis deprived classical music of one of its most outstanding artists  some believe she was the greatest english cellist of all time  but even if her personal narrative had not gripped the public imagination i reckon this would stand out as the elgar to end all elgars </s>
<s> just listen to the aching intensity of the slow movement the bravura of the epilogue </s>
<s> a performance of quite astonishing brilliance and beauty that makes us wonder what might have been </s>
<s> daniel barenboims complete mozart piano concertos emi  jacqueline du prés husband was also in his 20s when he undertook this groundbreaking adventure conducting the english chamber orchestra from the keyboard </s>
<s> barenboim is now in his early 70s and remains one of the most superb conductors pianists and thinkers in the world </s>
<s> he rerecorded the complete mozarts later in life with the berlin philharmonic but there is something so thrillingly youthful and fresh about this account  i could listen to them all day long </s>
<s> yehudi menuhin and george enescu on bachs concerto for two violins emi  george enescu was the romanian composer conductor pianist and violinist who taught many great violinists including yehudi menuhin who called him one of the true wonders of the world </s>

<s> in fact the solti ring as it became known redefined what was possible in scale ambition and sheer magnificence when it came to recorded classical music  and was so popular that decca reissued it in 2012 to mark the centenary of soltis birth </s>
<s> pablo casals bach suites emi  one of classical musics most spinetingling what if moments </s>
<s> in 1890 cellist pablo casals was just 13 years old when he took a stroll with his dad in the old port of barcelona and went browsing in a secondhand bookshop </s>
<s> there he unearthed the sheet music of bachs cello suites which had been consigned to the dustbin of musical history and not heard for eons </s>
<s> he spent a dozen years working on them and the result recorded changed the course not only of casals career but of classical music forever </s>
<s> carlos kleiber and the vienna philharmonics beethoven symphonies 5  7 dg  kleiber arguably one of the greatest conductors of all time was a famously reclusive perfectionist who didnt often record orchestral performances  his recordings of opera outstrip his symphonies fourtoone </s>
<s> yet there truly does not exist a more thrillingly wondrous performance of this beethoven double and trust me ive listened to a lot of them </s>
<s>  im not alone the consensus view is that these really are definitive </s>

<s> its a tune by the german eurodance group snap </s>
<s>  that was played a lot one summer as i travelled across europe </s>
<s> i hear just one refrain from it  its a soul companion you can feel it everywhere  and the late nights and sandy beaches come immediately to mind </s>
<s> but were i deliberately to try and remember something particular from that holiday without the music i would recall nothing as immediate or emotional </s>

<s> you can feel everything as if you were actually there </s>
<s> the relationship between music and memory is powerful and new research is hoping to discover how these memories work for therapeutic effect </s>
<s> it is already used to help dementia patients the elderly and for those suffering from depression </s>
<s> music has been an important mnemonic device for thousands of years </s>
<s> david c rubin is a specialist in autobiographical memory and oral traditions and in his groundbreaking book memory in oral traditions he explains how epic stories like homers the iliad and the odyssey were passed down verbally using poetic devices </s>
<s> before the narratives could be written down they were chanted or sung </s>
<s> oral tradition depended on memory </s>
<s> the hippocampus and the frontal cortex are two large areas in the brain associated with memory and they take in a great deal of information every minute </s>
<s> retrieving it is not always easy </s>
<s> it doesnt simply come when you ask it to </s>
<s> music helps because it provides a rhythm and rhyme and sometimes alliteration which helps to unlock that information with cues </s>
<s> it is the structure of the song that helps us to remember it as well as the melody and the images the words provoke </s>
<s> the technique remains important today </s>
<s> neuroscientists have analysed the brain mechanisms related to memory finding that words set to music are the easiest to remember </s>
<s> just think of one of the first songs you could well have sung abcdefg come along and sing with me </s>
<s> text learnt to music is better remembered when it is heard as a song rather than speech </s>
<s> try and remember anything set to a tune and your powers of recall will be stronger now ive sung my abc </s>
<s> all in the mind  there is a link then between music and memory but why when we hear a particular song do we feel strong emotions rather than just being able to recite the lyrics </s>
<s> if i listen to rhythm is a dancer i recall the amazing feeling of travelling without my parents for the first time and all the fun i had as much as the  lines of the song which i might add wasnt one i cared for particularly  the lyrics are banal or just plain bad </s>
<s> im as serious as cancer when i say rhythm is a dancer was described by one critic as the worst lyric of all time and yet it evokes profound feelings </s>
<s> there are different kinds of memory including explicit and implicit memory </s>
<s> explicit memory is a deliberate conscious retrieval of the past often posed by questions like where was i that summer </s>
<s> who was i travelling with </s>
<s> implicit memory is more a reactive unintentional form of memory </s>
<s> a large part of memory takes place in the unconscious mind robert snyder a composer and chair of the sound programme at the art institute of chicago tells me </s>
<s> there are aspects of memory that are remembered implicity that is outside of consciousness </s>
<s> whats more he says implicit memory systems involve different parts of the brain than explicit memory systems </s>
<s> it is the explicit memory systems that are damaged by conditions such as alzheimers disease </s>
<s> implicit systems are robust in comparison </s>
<s> snyder explains that things that can affect us from outside of consciousness are often regarded as powerful </s>
<s> in other words implicit memory is emotional as well as durable </s>
<s> notably memories stimulated by music often come from particular times in our lives </s>
<s> classic hits take us back to our teenage years and our twenties much more than songs of later years </s>
<s> psychologists have called it the reminiscence bump </s>
<s> it may work this way because this is an especially important and exciting time in our lives when we are experience things for the first time and when we become independent </s>
<s> everything is new and meaningful </s>
<s> later life becomes a bit of a blur </s>
<s> music evokes emotion but the sound and feeling of it while important dont necessary define your feelings </s>
<s> a sad song could be associated with a happy time a happy one with a sad one </s>
<s> soundtracks of our lives  its often pop music that evokes memories from this time in our lives </s>
<s> why </s>
<s> well for a start this music played in the background whether we selected it or not </s>
<s> there is always something on the radio in bars clubs and bedrooms that is contemporary and is almost accidentally attached to a particular time </s>
<s> pop music is also of the moment </s>
<s> listen to popular music from the 1960s and 1970s for example and you think you know what that time sounded like </s>
<s> there is something more abstract about say western classical music which has become more detached from its original time and may be harder to place </s>
<s> cretien van campen author of the proust effect the senses as doorways to lost memories researches the ways different senses act like the madeleine for the french author marcel proust in in search of lost time when a bite of the sweet cake takes him back to his childhood with all its smells colours and feelings </s>
<s> much of campens work studies the brain but he makes an important observation about what happens outside of our heads </s>
<s> smell differs in that it is a personal memory whereas there is something very social in our experience of music he points out </s>
<s> music memories are often shared with peers </s>
<s> we listen together </s>
<s> at a party it is something that we hear whilst dancing or chatting to a friend </s>
<s> we go to concerts or gigs with one another </s>
<s> and it is because music is there as part of lives spent with others  often significant others  that helps make it especially meaningful </s>
<s> indeed it is often played at or composed for significant occasions like funerals or weddings where we witness major life events </s>
<s> people who have suffered traumatic brain injuries will often have problems with memory </s>
<s> music can help bring back some of those special moments of their lives that they have forgotten </s>
<s> those suffering from dementia can trigger vivid memories by listening to music they heard when they were young </s>
<s> campen also highlights its uses for those with depression </s>
<s> it can assist people to recall difficult parts of their lives that were not necessarily as bad as they had thought </s>
<s> people who are depressed often feel as if there is a blanket over their lives </s>
<s> hearing music and remembering various experiences can help them remember the more complex experiences </s>
<s> its not that these are always positive he notes but they may be more rounded </s>
<s> music cannot cure but perhaps it can help heal </s>
<s> campen is optimistic about the future work people worry a lot today about forgetting and the problems with memory </s>
<s> but the beauty is today we are beginning to help with remembering </s>

<s> by greg kot 21 october 2014 blame it on the chorus the title track of one of the bestselling albums of all time bruce springsteens born in the usa released 30 years ago on 4 june is one of the singers most beloved songs </s>
<s> its also one of his most misunderstood and springsteen is at least partially complicit </s>
<s> with the americanflag backdrop on the album cover and the fistpumping energy springsteen and the e street band brought to the song on their subsequent stadium tour of the world a lot of fans heard born in the usa as a feelgood patriotic anthem </s>
<s> one of those fans happened to be conservative columnist george will who wrote glowingly about the tune as a cheerful affirmation of all things good about america </s>
<s> wills pal ronald reagan who happened to be president of the united states at the time then referenced springsteen and his songs of hope during his reelection campaign </s>
<s> will reagan and countless others never got past that big seemingly uplifting chorus to figure out what the song was really about </s>
<s> hardly a declaration of nationalistic pride born in the usa confronts the emptiness of the american dream </s>
<s> it describes vietnam veterans returning to a country in which workingclass people are treated like little more than cannon fodder </s>
<s> against the backdrop of an economic downturn that began to widen the gap between the haves and havenots the crestfallen verses mock the empty slogan in the chorus </s>
<s> it takes a close reading of the song to come to that conclusion though and springsteen made sure to underline the songs true message a decade later when he performed born in the usa as a bitter bluesy dirge on a solo tour </s>
<s> here are a few more  every breath you take the police 1983  it has a melody so elegant it sounds like the narrators swooning </s>

<s> sting wrote the tune from the perspective of a jilted lover who wants to maintain control over his ex </s>
<s> hardly the perfect wedding song as its often cast every breath you take instead expresses the kind of sentiment that gets a guy tossed in prison for stalking </s>

<s> i want candy strangeloves 1965  who could deny the presumably innocent exuberance of the bo diddley beat and that childlike demand in the chorus </s>

<s> of course what the song is really selling is sex </s>

<s> whats the lesson here </s>
<s> if a song sounds celebratory lovestruck childlike or salacious chances are thats the way the listening public will hear it no matter what most of the lyrics try to convey </s>

<s> they disappear into a statistical stratosphere occupied by a tiny elite of global megastars </s>
<s> there are simply too many territories to report on too many releases to keep track of too many vast numbers to juggle </s>
<s> all one can say with any certainty is that the swedish quartet have sold in excess of 380m albums and singles since they first came to prominence 40 years ago this month winning the 1974 eurovision song contest with a performance of waterloo that still ranks as the high point of the muchmaligned transcontinental cheesefest </s>
<s> at their commercial zenith in the late 70s abba were reputedly second only to volvo in their contribution to swedens exports </s>
<s> such was the demand for their music that their management had to arrange for royalties from the soviet union to be paid in oil commodity rights rather than the embargoed rouble </s>
<s> this was unprecedented popularity for an act from outside the englishspeaking world and as the recorded music business accustoms itself to the reduced circumstances of the digital age it seems unlikely that another artist will ever better it </s>
<s> meanwhile critically rehabilitated and driven on by the mamma mia </s>
<s> jukebox musical which has now played to over 54m people worldwide the bands records continue to sell </s>
<s> one day abba may well have sold half a billion records </s>
<s> for all that their music remains a curious anomaly  a universally successful sound based not in the riotous sexualised lingua franca of rock or rnb but in more homely restrained and european values </s>
<s> if rocknroll is about escape and outsiderdom then abbas pop songs excavate the dreams and disappointments of those who never wanted to rebel </s>
<s> summed up in the tumultuous ecstasy of dancing queen or the cascading fatalism of the winner takes it all suburbias hopes and fears are no less epic and no less valid </s>
<s> and there are an awful lot more people living there </s>
<s> swede dreams  the key to abba is their understated swedishness explains carl magnus palm author of the definitive biography of the band abba bright lights dark shadows </s>
<s> specifically its the importance to their music of swedish folk songs and of a sound called schlager which means hit in german </s>
<s> bereft of rhythm and blues or soul influences and cloyingly kitsch and sentimental to modern ears the central european sound of schlager was vastly popular  the soundtrack to a million camping holidays and cabaret evenings </s>
<s> its not cool music says palm but abba grew up loving schlager and they added other things that they loved like the beach boys and the beatles to that simple blueprint </s>
<s> millions of people related to it </s>
<s> and theres also a melancholy nordic streak even in abbas happiest songs </s>
<s> even in mamma mia theres some extra layer of sadness that you wouldnt hear in a contemporary record by say the brotherhood of man </s>
<s> theres a depth to abba that hints at deep sadness </s>
<s> that sadness was not imagined or confected </s>
<s> all four members of abba experienced private sorrows as they grew up in postwar sweden from family poverty to parental coldness and debilitating shyness </s>
<s> both benny andersson and annifrid frida lyngstad became unmarried parents before they reached 20 each had to make the decision to leave their children behind to pursue music </s>
<s> as abbas success grew benny beard married frida dark hair and beardless björn ulvaeus married blonde agnetha fältskog only for both couples to divorce towards the bands end </s>
<s> these marital breakdowns imbued abbas final albums super trouper and the visitors with a very adult pathos and resignation qualities which dismissed critical charges that the band made only vapid goodtime pop </s>
<s> but annifrids unhappiness was of a different order </s>
<s> fridas background is so painful that you wouldnt believe it if it was a work of fiction says palm </s>
<s> born out of wedlock in 1945 the daughter of an occupying german soldier and young norwegian girl synni lyngstad frida grew up fatherless and was ostracised as one of the shunned tyskerbarnas or german children </s>
<s> she and her mother moved to sweden for a fresh start only for synni to die suddenly of a kidney infection </s>
<s> brought the girl up in straitened circumstances by her hardworking but distant grandmother frida understandably developed a morose outlook on life </s>
<s> a withdrawn and plain girl with an amazing voice and beautiful handmade clothes desperately in need of a father figure  its almost too much even for an abba song </s>
<s> scarcely believable misfortune followed frida even after the end of abba </s>
<s> she married the swissborn prince heinrich ruzzo reuss of plauen in 1992 to become an actual princess </s>
<s> but the prince to died of lymphoma not long after fridas eldest daughter liselotte was killed in a car crash </s>
<s> super troupers  when the band finally hit the big time one of their strengths was that they were not newcomers arriving with the first songs theyd written </s>
<s> all four had over a decade of experience in songwriting recording and gruelling tours  hundreds of dates a year sometimes three shows a day  across swedens unforgiving municipal folkparks </s>
<s> björn had been a key member of the cleancut hootenanny singers the worst name that any band has ever had he once said </s>
<s> its just so ugly possibly beaten only by abba and benny played with swedish rock band the hep stars </s>
<s> agnetha already had a patchy career singing schlager and frida sang blues and jazz </s>
<s> though they formed abba at a low ebb in their individual fortunes the band was in fact a sort of supergroup </s>
<s> they were lucky in that theyd got most of their really bad songs out of their system before they formed abba says carl magnus palm </s>
<s> by then they were seasoned performers </s>
<s> when you see them on eurovision in 1974 you can tell that theyre not new to the stage </s>
<s> theyre confident they know what theyre doing </s>
<s> and they were perhaps lucky that they were initially popular only in sweden and scandinavia for the first few years of abba in 1972 and 1973 </s>
<s> by the time they came on the international scene with waterloo they had a much clearer picture of what they wanted to be </s>
<s> what they wanted to be was something new in pop  the companionable singalongs of schlager allied to meticulous songwriting and a giant wall of sound production drawn from the visionary american producer phil spector the beach boys and the englishspeaking pop tradition </s>
<s> detail would be everything and key to abbas success was studio engineer michael tretow who created a form of doubletracking which duplicated the instruments and made the band sound enormous </s>
<s> abba didnt just have better songs </s>
<s> they sounded like nothing wed heard before </s>
<s> when you listen to the name of the game by abba its just got so many bits in it far more than you notice at first observes neil tennant ivor novellowinning singer with pet shop boys </s>
<s> theyre all incredibly catchy and moving at the same time </s>
<s> they gently bring up that yearning phil spector quality that is so marvellous </s>
<s> abba dissolved at the end of 1982 and by now even the most committed fan surely accepts that they will never work together again </s>
<s> the legal acrimony of the postsplit years has ebbed away and by all accounts the four former members of abba get along well now </s>
<s> with the mamma mia musical playing around the world  enabling the music to tour without the band and as a sideline resurrecting the stage musical  there seems little need for a reunion and little to prove either </s>
<s> abba didnt just write great songs they made great records and that was their secret says palm </s>
<s> they conceived them as productions and arrangements  visions of perfect pop music </s>
<s> why are there so few successful covers of abba songs </s>
<s> because theyre just so hard to inhabit </s>

<s> not because im fervently patriotic but because i come from a family of passionate football fans combined with my love of music and my general fondness for anything a bit sentimental that seems to have made my penchant for a good anthem inevitable </s>
<s> plus im married to a welshman and as anybody with even a passing familiarity with rugby knows the welsh take their beautiful national anthem very seriously indeed </s>
<s> my experience with national anthems began early when my two older brothers sat me down to watch britains fa cup final when i was about five and we all sang along  with mostly madeup words  at the tops of our voices before kickoff </s>
<s> a decade later during the european football championships in 1996 i was at wembley to watch england thrash holland 41 </s>
<s> the football was fantastic of course  what would we give to be able to beat holland or anyone 41 these days </s>
<s>  but it was the experience of belting out the national anthem amid 80000 people that really sticks in my mind </s>
<s> in 2000 i was living in paris on a year off before i went to university </s>
<s> arsenal my favourite football club had many french players at the time so i felt like france was my adopted national team </s>
<s> i even went to rotterdam to watch france take on italy in the final of the european championships and sang along with the red blue and white half of the crowd to le marseillaise before kickoff </s>
<s> i found the whole thing deeply moving  no matter that there is not a single french bone in my body </s>
<s> a decade after paris i was living in new york where my husband was working at the united nations </s>
<s> ill never forget the magical experience of piling into a flagdraped tv room at the iconic un building to watch world cup games live from south africa with dozens of un employees from all around the world </s>
<s> i doubt anyone there did much real work during the course of the tournament but i suspect it was a particularly golden time for international relations as diplomats of all nationalities bunked off to watch the football and toot vuvuzelas together </s>
<s> one of the most memorable aspects of that summer was hearing at close hand so many people from so many different countries singing their own national anthems at close quarters  from ghana to paraguay côte divoire to new zealand </s>
<s> and of course living in the us for four years we heard a lot of renditions of the starspangled banner a classic anthem i could never fail to sing along to whether it be ironically as the brit at fourth of july barbeques or rather more earnestly at baseball a sport whose connection to the anthem is inextricable </s>
<s> sonic nationalism  the anthems at the 2012 london olympics were performed by members of the london philharmonic orchestra and the man responsible for arranging all 205 of them was the composer and cellist philip sheppard </s>
<s> there is definitely a national anthem formula he tells bbc culture and its a westernised format as if people have just gone through a methodist hymnal and picked a march with dotted rhythms often in bflat major and a clichéd trumpet tune </s>
<s> its the anthems that are anomalous to that which tend to be brilliant </s>
<s> songs that come up from the street rather than being imposed by the state can be kind of magical and genuinely stirring </s>
<s> my adopted anthem le marseillaise is one such example sheppard says </s>
<s> that comes from a genuine place and a genuine motivation  its a revolutionary piece by the french people </s>
<s> its the opposite of the anthems that are consciously commissioned by a state and which rather blend one into another so you get this weird situation in which a central african states anthem like cameroons sounds just like one from eastern europe </s>
<s> sheppard reckons anthems are hard to judge from an objective musical standpoint </s>
<s> the reason so many anthems are marching tunes is because thats often a reason for it existing it is literally something to rally people behind sheppard points out </s>
<s> so like a flag it becomes an instrument of the state </s>
<s> and its potentially dynamite you mess with an anthem at your peril because people will live and die for them </s>
<s> so you can have a social opinion but you cant put a value judgement on an anthem </s>
<s> it would be like having an opinion about oxygen </s>
<s> this might be the lifeblood of someones nation so whos to say if it has musical merit </s>
<s>   for this reason sheppard  who received death threats in 2012 after an online article listing the 10 worst anthems in which he was quoted went viral will not mention the national tunes he doesnt rate </s>
<s> but when i ask him to name some of his favourites he mentions russias i love it </s>
<s> putin restored the old soviet anthem from the 1940s and its a stunning piece of music </s>
<s> it sounds like a workers revolutionary song but its got a scrunchiness to the harmony that makes it so beautiful </s>
<s> he also praises brazils which he says perfectly fits the social mood of that country which in my experience tends to have 50 more active energy than anywhere else on earth </s>
<s>   the world cups host nation aside sheppard is a fan of many of the latin american national anthems </s>
<s> you have this italianate opera tradition in south america he explains </s>
<s> many of their anthems wouldnt sound out of place in la scala theyre fabulous </s>
<s> you hear those anthems brazil bolivia and uruguay youre up on your feet </s>
<s>  uruguay </s>
<s>  i shriek at him in horror but sheppard cant help but concede that despite how they knocked out england from the world cup in the quickest time in history hes a fan </s>
<s> their anthem is six minutes 50 seconds long and it has about six different tunes inside its like an entire overture in the verdi style </s>
<s>  he laughs </s>
<s> so im afraid they win not just on football terms but on anthems too  it was announced recently that the great opera singer placido domingo will perform before the world cup final on 11 july </s>
<s> i always think music and sport are the two great things many people can understand without any need to really speak the language the 73yearold legend said when asked why he wanted to be involved </s>

<s> when artists get famous quickly what is the script for the second act </s>
<s> with kurt cobain well never know </s>
<s> but he left behind a few clues </s>
<s> whats most inspiring about cobain is how much he accomplished and how quickly he expanded his artistic horizons in such a short time </s>
<s> would his creative restlessness have continued </s>
<s> if cobain were alive today he would be 47 years old </s>
<s> who would he be working with and how would he fit into the musical and cultural landscape </s>
<s> cobain was wellarmed to deal with whatever came his way partly because of some particularly underappreciated traits  adaptability and humour </s>
<s> cultural historians and journalists tend to focus on cobain as the distressed depressed grungeera slacker the epitome of a generation that had lost its way </s>
<s> that does everyone a disservice because it reduces cobain to a caricature  or a statue </s>
<s> one does wonder what cobain would have thought of the concrete statue of himself unveiled a few weeks ago in his hometown of aberdeen washington </s>
<s> on the 20th anniversary of his death from a selfinflicted gunshot wound it captures cobain as a grunge cliche with ripped jeans and a tear rolling from his right eye </s>
<s> missing from a lot of the st kurt eulogising that has become a cottage industry over the last two decades is the notion that cobain actually had a wicked albeit dark wit </s>
<s> its there in the songs the cutup lyrics and startling juxtapositions showing that he not only appreciated the absurdity of his extraordinary fame and success but that he was complicit in it </s>
<s> teenage kicks  in nirvanas serve the servants cobain sang teenage angst has paid off wellnow im bored and old </s>
<s> that could be read as cynical and despairing but it also shows cobain could laugh at himself </s>
<s> almost nothing he did was particularly transparent </s>
<s> what made him interesting as an artist  the complexity the contradictions the onionlike layers of interpretation opened up by the way he strung words together was also what distinguished him as a human being </s>
<s> how much of it is calculated well never know </s>
<s> but my contribution to the parade of hyperbole about cobain is that he may have been the most complicated rock star since bob dylan a mainstream artist who turned inscrutability into an art form </s>
<s> it suggests that he didnt want to be pinned down and i doubt he intended to turn nirvana into a lifetime forevertouring money machine like the rolling stones </s>
<s> for all its flaws the tearstained aberdeen statue does suggest what might have been had cobain lived </s>
<s> it depicts him sitting on a barstool with what appears to be a guitar shaped much like the acousticelectric martin model he used during nirvanas classic 1993 mtv unplugged performance </s>
<s> as late as november 1993 only a few months before his suicide cobain would talk excitedly about his next move </s>
<s> he wanted acoustic instruments and more textured arrangements for the next album something that would plunge him deeper into the introspective shadows and subterranean beauty of a nick drake or a skip spence cofounder of moby grape rather than the scorchedearth fury of in utero tracks like milk it or rape me </s>
<s> the approach defined by mtv unplugged in new york was one possible way forward </s>
<s> on that album cobain found new inspiration by digging into the music of his heroes and inspirations leadbelly the meat puppets david bowie and the vaselines </s>
<s> he reduced the songs to their barest essentials voice guitar a bit of bass brushed drums </s>
<s> on penny royal tea it was just him and his guitar </s>
<s> am i doing this or not </s>
<s>  nirvana drummer dave grohl asked before the song began but cobain waved him off </s>
<s> he wasnt ready to limit himself to only one musical genre played with the same collaborators </s>
<s> soul searching  only months before cobain had sounded uncertain interrogating himself on nirvanas final studio album in utero  what else should i be </s>
<s> what else could i say </s>
<s> what else should i write </s>
<s>   mtv unplugged provided some answers a way to stay a step ahead of boredom and irrelevance </s>
<s> rems michael stipe has said that he and cobain were talking about collaborating in the weeks before the singers death </s>
<s> and now its quite possible to imagine cobain not like some of his counterparts as the proprietor of a heritage act  nirvana the 25th anniversary tour </s>
<s>   but as a musical vagabond jumping in and out of diverse projects in the way his old seattle peer mark lanegan of screaming trees has done </s>
<s> hed no longer be at the centre of popular culture but he wouldnt be a nostalgia act either </s>
<s> cobain never felt completely comfortable as the centre of attention he once said that he coveted john lennons fame but he also wanted ringo starrs anonymity </s>
<s> so my guess is he would have kept moving flitting from project to project much like a dylan lanegan lou reed or neil young in search of new inspiration rather than becoming a greatesthits jukebox </s>
<s> he probably wouldnt be a jay zstyle celebrity anymore because he never craved that constant level of media attention </s>
<s> but the work would keep him relevant because he would be restless and curious enough to keep exploring </s>
<s> what else should i be </s>
<s>  would be a constant question with a new answer every year </s>
<s> who might he be collaborating with today </s>
<s> artists with a flair for musical risktaking and cutting humour would have appealed to him queens of the stone ages josh homme the julie ruins kathleen hanna jack white </s>
<s> he wouldve been a natural to produce the inevitable comeback album by sleaterkinney </s>
<s> and you just know that kanye west would have booked some studio time with him in mind </s>
<s> whether cobain wouldve shown up is another matter </s>
<s> instead he might have run away on tour with his 80s heroes punkmetal oldtimers the melvins as their first millionaire roadie </s>

<s> in the aftermath his estate gave sony permission to release 10 albums of vaultscoured music in exchange for 250m </s>
<s> thats in addition to posthumous projects such as the this is it movie and the michael jackson cirque du soleil show in las vegas </s>
<s> the first of the sony albums michael surfaced in 2010 </s>
<s> presumably it included the best of the vast jackson archive spiffed up by an army of producers including teddy riley john mcclain and lenny kravitz </s>
<s> it was presented as the first new jackson studio album since 2001 but it barely caused a ripple  only one of its four singles grazed the top 40 </s>
<s> the reaction was hardly a surprise the album wasnt an embarrassment so much as a collection of mediocrities belowpar cuts that fell short of jacksons standards </s>
<s> now a second studio release is expected on 13 may xscape </s>

<s> after all big names such as elvis presley jimi hendrix tupac shakur nirvanas kurt cobain the doors jim morrison the grateful deads jerry garcia and countless others have proven at least as prolific in death as they were in life often with less than scintillating results </s>
<s> get back   consider the beatles whose brand is perhaps most comparable to jacksons in musical pop culture </s>
<s> though john lennons 1980 murder quashed any notion of a fullscale beatles reunion it stirred a wave of beatles merchandise culminating in the mid90s anthology series of doublecds </s>
<s> bolstered by just a couple of reunion singles recorded with the voice of the late lennon and a batch of recordings that band members and producer george martin had for decades declared inferior and unworthy of release the anthology series doesnt add much to the bands revered canon </s>
<s> even bill king the editor of the authoritative beatlefan magazine acknowledged at the time that the anthology series was akin to buying a book of an artists sketches before he painted the masterpiece the first thing you hear on the first anthology is a bunch of kids bashing about on some not very good quality sounding recordings </s>
<s> yet buoyed by a saturation media campaign and the seemingly insatiable appetite for all things fab  here there and everywhere no matter how inconsequential  the beatles outsold every single artist in the us in 1996 </s>
<s> cash in the attic   name a pop star who died young and ill show you a shoddy cashin campaign </s>
<s> hendrix released three studio albums in his lifetime but dozens of albums collecting his studio scraps have surfaced since his death in 1970 </s>
<s> tupac shakur managed four albums in his brief life but seven came out after he was gunned down in 1996 </s>
<s> the first of these the don killuminati was described by entertainment weekly as a disgraceful exploitation that dishonors shakurs music and legacy </s>

<s> in interviews jones would talk about his protégés willingness to work to the brink of exhaustion and his perfectionist impulse </s>
<s> if both he and jackson felt a song was up to par it wouldnt have been left to languish jones said </s>
<s> many were recorded few were chosen </s>
<s> there was a reason the duo had about 800 songs in the running for thriller before settling on nine which added up to the biggest selling album in pop history </s>
<s> you make up your mind on the tunes youre going to do and you do it </s>
<s> everybody wants to sell millions of records but the idea of trying to pick out what people are going to like and buy is garbage jones once told me as he looked over jacksons career </s>

<s> the only consolation i can take from this is that im not alone </s>
<s> i often hear from listeners on my bbc radio 3 breakfast show who say theyre revisiting in adulthood the instruments they gave up as children and its invariably the keyboard to which they return </s>
<s> guardian editor alan rusbridger recently wrote a beautiful book  play it again an amateur against the impossible  that explores the year he spent learning chopins no ballade 1 aged 56 </s>
<s> and he was just one of the many highprofile amateur pianists including actor simon russell beale and the former uk chancellor of the exchequer ed balls who were persuaded to tackle schumanns kinderszenen scenes from childhood live onstage at a concert in london last year </s>
<s> gluttons for punishment </s>
<s> so whats behind this trend i wonder </s>
<s> why are so many otherwise sane adults submitting themselves to the strictures of daily scales and arpeggios and asking the terrifying question of whether an adult brain is still plastic enough to learn  and memorise  some of the most complex music ever written </s>
<s> its an overriding passion not just for the music but for the challenge reckons lucy parham the leading concert pianist who taught rusbridger his chopin </s>
<s> and the challenge is constant theres always a harder piece you can always take it to the next level youre never finished </s>
<s> but theres also the fact that the piano is your friend its always there </s>
<s> that gathers more significance as you get older what you can express through it in a personal language becomes incredibly important </s>
<s> this is certainly true for british actor and director samuel west who tells me he recently bought himself a proper piano again and has started practising daily for the first time in 30 years </s>
<s> as an adult youre much more knowledgeable about your own moods so it becomes much more possible to use music as a way to express yourself he says </s>
<s> if i have a little piece i can play i can listen to myself better i can express myself better </s>
<s> thats entirely a function of being older and thats a joy </s>
<s> west also an amateur cellist had nurtured a desire to master the aria from bachs goldberg variations for as long as he could remember </s>
<s> it was something i felt i really ought to know </s>
<s> its simple but its difficult and complex enough to keep me going until i die </s>
<s> consider glenn gould he rarely ever recorded the same piece twice but he famously rerecorded the goldberg variations when he was older despite having had huge acclaim when he was twentythree </s>
<s> he didnt feel hed said enough </s>

<s> the feat wasnt always easy some bands really didnt want people to use their toilets he says even though we promised we would clean them after </s>

<s> although berlin is no longer as freewheeling as it was then that same anarchic attitude still remains a part of the citys social fabric </s>
<s> i think a lot of berliners now undervalue that there are still a lot of undefined spaces here she says </s>

<s> it also helps that the citys reasonable rents make it more likely that people have sizeable living rooms to throw concerts in </s>

<s> i guess you cant do that so much anymore she says but you can look at their books and seeing a persons apartment still tells you a lot about the person </s>

<s> george gershwin 18981937  gerschwin was jazzage prophet whose rhapsody in blue 1924 destabilised aesthetic categories and gave listeners a taste of things to come and whose controversial 1935 opera porgy  bess came to define an epoch </s>
<s> but gershwin was caught in the crossfire between those who see mass culture as the most valid expression of our time and those who see it as the end of western civilization as gershwin scholar david schiff puts it </s>

<s> numbers letters and days of the week have their own shade the number one is white the letter l is blue and monday is red </s>
<s> this neurological phenomenon is called synaesthesia if you dont have it it sounds strange like the straining of an overactive imagination </s>
<s> but if youre part of the estimated four per cent of the population who are synaesthetes such descriptions are as obvious and natural as the sky being blue and the grass being green </s>
<s> synaesthesia is best described as a union of the senses one sensory experience involuntarily and consistently prompts another </s>
<s> there are up to 70 different types  from tasting the time to smelling a symphony  although the most common involve colour </s>
<s> i have graphemecolour synaesthesia </s>
<s> numbers days months and letters and by extension words have their own very distinct shades </s>
<s> the examples above are my own l could only ever be blue </s>
<s> this is the most common form of synaesthesia and it wasnt until i was in my early twenties that i realised not everyone sees the world this way  indeed the assertion that words have a certain colour can be met with sneering scepticism </s>

<s> talk to another synaesthete however and theyll often disagree with you howlingly about the colour or even the precise shade </s>
<s> one friend has tastes and textures as well as colours for words </s>
<s> while i find my synaesthesia has little impact on my day to day life for her its a curse as much as a blessing </s>
<s> there are words she cant say without physically cringing </s>
<s> for others however synaesthesia can actually be a bonus aiding their creative endeavours </s>
<s> research on synaesthesia is not as extensive as you might expect it was disregarded as a phenomenon until the advent of mri scans in the late 1980s proving that corresponding areas of the brain really do light up in synaesthetes  but its thought it may be more common in artists </s>
<s> the art of noise  synaesthesia has been something of a hot topic in music news recently with the likes of pharrell williams kanye west lady gaga dev hynes and frank ocean suddenly keen to talk up their colourful experiences </s>

<s> that might be overstating it but there is a rich history of it in the arts </s>
<s> notable synaesthetes or suspected ones given its relatively recent currency and familiarity as a scientific term include composers olivier messiaen franz liszt and jean sibelius russian author vladimir nabokov artists vincent van gogh and david hockney jazz legend duke ellington and even marilyn monroe </s>
<s> one man helping to educate the public is british composer nick ryan </s>
<s> he has graphemecolour synaesthesia but also sees corresponding colours shapes and textures to sound and music </s>
<s> like pharrell he sees his synaesthesia as a boon  it makes listening to music very enjoyable  and he has long wanted to recreate it for a nonsyn audience </s>

<s> highly textured precisely coloured digital imagery was projected on a large screen morphing to match his music which blended electronics with sounds made by the london contemporary orchestra </s>
<s> i wanted it to be multisensory because such is the nature of synaesthesia he says </s>
<s> its a sensation scrapbook which the audience is immersed in </s>
<s> electronic booms were matched on screen by crashing waves of monochrome static sustained growling strings and deep bass were illustrated with slowly warping spidery nets and grids of deep pink and icewhite </s>

<s> perhaps best known is wassily kandinsky whose abstract paintings  were his experience of seeing music in colour line and form </s>
<s> his 1911 work impression iii concert was inspired by a concert in munich at which he heard the music of arnold schoenberg and while the painting has some representational elements its vivid wash of yellow describes sound itself </s>
<s> kandinsky wrote on the subject with a spiritual fervour colour is the keyboard </s>
<s> the eye is the hammer </s>
<s> the soul is the piano with its many strings </s>
<s> the artist is the hand that purposely sets the soul vibrating by means of this or that key </s>
<s> kandinsky played the cello  an instrument that for him evoked a deep blue a colour he also used heavily </s>
<s> although not commonly cited as a synaesthete its interesting to note that henri matisse described the same rich deep blue  famously used in his blue nudes  as affecting the viewer like a vigorous stroke of a gong </s>
<s> writers have also used their craft to recreate the synaesthetic experience </s>
<s> both arthur rimbaud and charles baudelaire are thought to have been synaesthetes and both are notable for actually tackling the subject headon </s>
<s> for baudelaire there was a relationship between sensation and emotion </s>
<s> we may be in the realm of the metaphorical here  he was a fan the theologian emanuel swedenborgs theory that every element of existence corresponds to another in a spiritual sense of universal connection </s>
<s> but his 1857 sonnet correspondences is still viscerally evocative in describing intertwined sensations perfumes and sounds and colours correspond </s>
<s>  some scents are cool as childrens flesh is cool  sweet as are oboes green as meadowlands </s>

<s> the woodstock music  art fair hosted what was supposed to be a festival of peace love and music 45 years ago </s>
<s> three days turned into four and the 100000 fans that were expected to show up turned into 500000 </s>
<s> for one rainy weekend in 1969 the rural community of bethel became the third largest city in new york state </s>
<s> woodstock supposedly defined a generation and showcased some of the greatest music of the 60s or so we have been told over and over again </s>
<s> but did it really </s>
<s> the lasting legacy of woodstock was that it became a crucible moment for a community of young people thrown into a mud bath for a weekend </s>
<s> its not that the music didnt matter but it wasnt the main reason why woodstock made history or even the primary memory for most of the festivalgoers </s>
<s> woodstock brought hundreds of thousands of people to an inconvenient location using dozens of bands as a lure  thats the same formula for countless summer megafestivals today </s>
<s> but the sheer size of these events ensures that the music becomes a soundtrack  rather than a focal point for a weekend of peace love and partying like an extra in a nicki minaj video </s>
<s> woodstocklike rock and dance music festivals now so thoroughly dominate the north american and european concert business in the summer that its difficult to tell them apart </s>
<s> they are all in a way working off the template set by woodstock </s>
<s> and as seasoned festivalgoers can attest these gatherings often become as much about the fans interacting with one another as with the music </s>
<s> the rituals codified by woodstock explain why </s>
<s> before woodstock there was the monterey international pop festival in california in 1967 </s>
<s> it was a weekend in which otis redding jimi hendrix the who and janis joplin became icons overnight in part because people could actually see and hear their performances in relative comfort </s>
<s> the performance arena held about 7000 people and though many more congregated on the grounds outside the music was the primary draw </s>
<s> at woodstock most of the festivalgoers never got close to the stage and most barely heard or saw the performers </s>
<s> the chaotic atmosphere didnt help either </s>
<s> marty balin singer in jefferson airplane which played both woodstock and monterey once told me monterey was a lot more organised and a lot more about the music </s>
<s> woodstock was about fun  </s>
<s> but we didnt get to go on till dawn the last day and by then wed gotten drunk and sobered up four times </s>
<s> it wasnt our greatest moment </s>
<s> singin in the rain  this was a cultural happening in which the music was drowned out not only by the rain but the magnitude of the event itself </s>
<s> promoters built fences and set up 1000 portable toilets which soon proved no match for the horde of fans descending on the farm field outside woodstock </s>
<s> a sound system custommade for the event including 70ft 21m speaker towers was also overwhelmed by sheer numbers </s>
<s> we set it up for 150000 to 200000 people engineer bill hanley once said </s>
<s> of course 500000 showed up </s>
<s> countless more never made it as the new york state highway system was clogged with wouldbe festival attendees </s>
<s> only one large stage held the performers and no video screens were set up those wouldnt become standard features at festivals until decades later </s>
<s> so most of the performers looked the size of ants to the audience if they could be seen at all </s>
<s> the weekend turned into a struggle for basic amenities  food shelter toilets  as rain turned the field into a muddy quagmire </s>
<s> yet many who attended and documented the festival still romanticise it </s>
<s> in the tradition of great american roadtrips woodstock was the ultimate destination experience for the vietnam war babies who showed up turned on and rolled in the mud together </s>
<s> meanwhile in the distant background hendrix sly stone and santana were burning themselves into the consciousness of a relatively lucky few who could get close enough to see and hear them </s>
<s> even danny goldberg a longtime musicindustry executive who covered woodstock as a 20yearold freelance writer once told me he went to see the bands but came away more impressed by the vibe </s>
<s> my biggest memory was getting there and the warmth the good feeling of everybody  the music was less of a memory </s>
<s> the pioneering critic ellen sander acknowledged that though the lineup was stellar the performances were the least significant events of what happened over the woodstock weekend </s>
<s> rite of passage  similarly todays festivals offer music as a way to lure fans to a faraway place but for many fans the event is about the experience as much as the bands </s>
<s> in general its easier to see and hear the performers but they rarely command everyones attention </s>
<s> part of the reason is that music festivals have become about more than just music theyre also about selling merchandise promoting products and building tourism </s>
<s> multiday events such as coachella in california and austin city limits acl in texas inject many millions of dollars into local economies bringing in revenue for surrounding restaurants bars and hotels </s>
<s> overexposure also dilutes the musics impact </s>
<s> so many festivals clog the summer schedule that theres rarely anything particularly unique about the lineups </s>
<s> many major bands play multiple festivals in one summer arcade fire for example headlined both coachella and glastonbury in the uk in recent months </s>
<s> outkast not only played coachella this year but lollapalooza in chicago roskilde in denmark and just about every festival in between </s>
<s> whos playing can often become beside the point </s>
<s> festivals are a rite of passage says charlie jones coowner of c3 presents which promotes lollapalooza and acl  a rite of passage in which music is just one of the attractions not the attraction </s>
<s> no wonder lollapalooza and glastonbury festivals have sold out in advance the last few years before any of the bands were even announced </s>

<s> this is the reformed radiophonic workshop carrying the banner for a particular and very british strain of handmade invention </s>
<s> the avantgarde music known as radiophonics influenced pop from the beatles through to modern dance music and techno even though its progenitors were not eccentric art visionaries but salaried bbc engineers and composers who never earned royalties from their work </s>
<s> in its golden period from 1958 to the late 70s the bbc radiophonic workshop created music by hitting old pieces of machinery resonating household objects generating white noise and manipulating the resulting sounds until their origins were lost but new moods and truths about the world emerged </s>
<s> this was electronic music in an age before consumer electronics utilising the techniques of music concrète and the logic of futurism to open up a new aural world </s>
<s> as doctor who turns 50 this year the workshops most famous work is back in the spotlight </s>

<s> derbyshire even moonlighted to cocreate the music for the tomorrow people  itvs rival to doctor who  under a pseudonym </s>
<s> but derbyshire slipped into disillusion and alcoholism and died at 64 in 2001 just as a new generation of musicians was beginning to extol the value of her work </s>
<s> delia was wonderful to work with but she had an exponential curve to her enthusiasm and it was downwards explains dick mills of the reformed radiophonic workshop who collaborated with her on the doctor who theme </s>
<s> i wont decry her achievement in any way but she got her satisfaction in the planning not the execution </s>
<s> she thought it was better to travel than to arrive </s>
<s> but her creations for radio and tv were astonishing </s>
<s> mills describes the radiophonic workshop as coming into being by happy accident </s>
<s> after learning that tape recorders could replace the vinyl records they used to play in live sound effect bbc drama producers found that if you mistreated the machines voice effects and nightmarish sounds would result </s>
<s> one of the early criticisms says mills was that we produced sounds that nobody liked for plays that nobody could understand </s>
<s> orders for music began to pour in from the rest of the bbc especially from local radio </s>
<s> when radio sheffield asked for a short jingle to identify the station the workshops david cain built it from the sounds of cutlery </s>
<s> they created the sound of a halo of bees around a saints head for a religious broadcast and for westminster at work their engineer john harrison climbed inside big ben to record its maintenance engineers </s>
<s> but when cheap synthesisers came into the picture the radiophonic workshops future grew cloudier </s>
<s> in the early 90s a new bbc policy called producer choice obliged the workshop to compete with commercial providers and show a profit </s>
<s> its musicians and engineers proved to be no masters of the spreadsheet </s>
<s> the rot set in when doctor who ended in 1989 says mills who had provided special sound on the programme since the 1960s </s>
<s> the bbc moved him to remaster the sound on archive tapes </s>
<s> they used to pay me to put horrible noises on tv programmes he says and now they were paying me to take them off </s>
<s> mills left the workshop in 1993 and in 1998 it closed </s>
<s> variations on a theme  this would have been the end of the story except that many musicians who reached maturity in the 90s had grown up with doctor who </s>
<s> artists from stereolab to aphex twin to broadcast began to quote from radiophonics </s>

<s> ive been drawn to that sound since i was a child says paul hartnoll of electronic duo orbital </s>
<s> it creeped me out but it also made me feel a bit melancholy and i loved that </s>
<s> it was the equivalent of looking at a tower block and finding it oppressive but beautiful too </s>
<s> we thought a lot of younger people wouldnt even know it but it really resonated with them </s>
<s> in 2008 for the 50th anniversary of the founding of the radiophonic workshop the british dance duo coldcut performed a new remixed reedited work based on original radiophonic recordings for the bbc electric proms </s>
<s> you can locate the beginning of electronic music as far back as the futurist art of noises manifesto in 1913 says the duos matt black </s>
<s> but realistically the doctor who theme is where it began </s>
<s> that title sequence was the catalyst for everything that we do with sound and visuals too </s>

<s> but true to its most famous client they have also regenerated with a different face and personality but the same core ideas </s>
<s> backed by the arts council and the bbc the electronic composer and dance music producer matthew herbert has assembled a loose new group including theatre directors academics radio producers and people who build robots as well as musicians </s>
<s> the original radiophonic workshop was collaborative democratic and almost anonymous says herbert </s>
<s> they had the incredible bravery that comes from not having to justify what youre doing against a budget </s>
<s> we wanted to apply that spirit to the digital context </s>
<s> we are now living in the future that the radiophonic workshop used to imagine he thinks </s>
<s> music has become very easy to make which raises the question why are you making it </s>
<s> making music the radiophonic way was bloody hard says herbert </s>

<s> what the kriegskinder did not come to terms with they passed onto us grandchildren writes senfft </s>

<s> helwig found this when she had children herself </s>
<s> it took me becoming a parent to actually be able to really empathise with my parents having witnessed world war two at the ages of five and six she says </s>
<s> the idea for this book came when i was talking to my friends asking them how are we going to teach our children about this history and how do we keep them interested in it  or how do we teach them the responsibility which comes with it </s>

<s> every german knows about the holocaust were educated with it its been documented at large but what hasnt really been talked about in german families is what did the greatgrandfather do or what exactly happened  there still seems to be a taboo there </s>

<s> that generation is now at a time where theyve carried all this for a long time and a lot of the people we interviewed were actually quite open about it but said that many people were not really interested in what they had to say </s>
<s> helwig hopes that by bringing together recollections from childhoods in nazi germany with portraits of a generation whose memories will soon vanish her book can help change that </s>
<s> theres an emotional process happening and through that emotional process hopefully it creates a curiosity to ask more questions and to have frank conversations to be able to access that time she says </s>
<s> its not about victimising this generation its important to try and encourage the generations to start talking to each other </s>

<s> instead of forking out around 1 a character for a personalised version she took a different approach  she paid 20000 plus vat per season sponsorship </s>
<s> i think im the only writer doing this she explains </s>
<s> i was on the board at raith and like many lower division scottish football clubs money has always been a challenge </s>
<s> we had one shirt sponsor but they didnt want to continue so it was beneficial for me to step in </s>
<s> its been great </s>
<s> ive really got a lot of bang for my bucks from it and raised my profile as an author </s>
<s> i realised it had really gone far and wide when i got a call from the new york times </s>
<s> but while mcdermid went to great lengths to have her name emblazoned on shirts other fans have to settle for replica versions of team strips </s>
<s> even this can cost dedicated supporters hundreds of pounds to keep up with changing football fashions </s>
<s> mcdermid believes big clubs shirt prices are often pitched ridiculously high for fans who are being gouged in their efforts to show their support </s>
<s> south of the border shirt politics are even more contentious </s>
<s> and really big business </s>
<s> the growing cost of replica kits replicas are the official ones sold in club shops and other high street sportswear chains and the increasing regularity with which the elite football teams alter not only their firstchoice but also their second and thirdchange strips is a sensitive issue for clubs especially those that feature in the english premier league </s>
<s> the price of replica shirts has come a long way since leeds united became the first club to sell a replica shirt to fans in 1973 for the princely sum of 5 </s>
<s> an adult shirt from the side today costs more than ten times that amount at full price </s>
<s> since the season of 201112 premier league fans have faced an 18 </s>
<s> 5 increase in shirt prices with the average adult shirt costing 50 </s>
<s> 90 in 201718 according to research by peter rohlmann a marketing analyst who specialises in football merchandise </s>
<s> kits for children have increased in a similar way with a junior replica shirt costing 19 </s>
<s> 8 more last season  an average of 40 </s>
<s> 25  than it did six years earlier </s>
<s> according to the bbcs annual price of football survey premier league champions manchester city along with manchester united and tottenham hotspur sold the most expensive adult shirts last season priced at 6066 </s>
<s> united also sold the most expensive junior shirt priced at 51 </s>
<s> 78 </s>
<s> but it is not just the cost of the shirts that is changing  the number of strips released is also increasing </s>
<s> in the summer of 2017 10 clubs released three different strips for the season </s>
<s> third kits were originally used in case of a clash between a teams away kit and a home club strip </s>
<s> but now clubs are introducing third kits more and more </s>
<s> for instance newcastle united had four kits in 201112  home away a third and a europa league kit </s>

<s> and at an eyewateringly expensive 110 a blue 1968 commemorative kit for 20182019 from manchester united sparked a backlash from fans when it was unveiled in may </s>
<s> while prices have soared in the premier league they are far from being the most expensive football shirts around </s>
<s> in fact fans in other parts of europe pay more </s>
<s> in italy fans pay an average 76 </s>
<s> 54 66 </s>
<s> 91 per shirt while in france and germany it can cost fans 78 </s>
<s> 03 68 </s>
<s> 21 and 81 </s>
<s> 34 71 </s>
<s> 10 per shirt respectively </s>
<s> the difference argues rohlmann is that the prices in the uk have increased stepbystep each season </s>
<s> the reasons for the continuous rise in kit prices are varied he explains </s>
<s> the huge increase in kit supply sponsorships goes handinhand with the target of refinancing the spending on these deals by a permanent uplift of replica prices for fans </s>
<s> rohlmann is analysing what appears to be a shift in the kind of sponsorship deals done by premier league sides and shirt prices </s>
<s> as an example manchester united currently have a 10year kit deal with adidas worth 750m in which the sportswear manufacturer pays money to the club up front to secure a licensing deal </s>
<s> while traditionally sponsors might have bought rights to sponsor everything from stadiums to socks most modern deals focus on giving the sponsor the right to use the clubs intellectual property and through the club players image rights </s>
<s> the kit manufacturer is able to set the price of replica kits so that it can earn a concrete return on their investment sponsorship </s>
<s> this contrasts with trying to calculate something like brand value exposure and engagement as way of assessing a return on their investment </s>
<s> these deals are also increasingly determining the design of new shirts each season says chris stride a statistician at the university of sheffield who has studied the evolution of replica football kits </s>
<s> football shirts have transitioned from a sportswear product whose primary purpose was for players to play in through a period in which they became profitable replica sportswear for children to becoming leisurewear for young adults and then for adults of all ages stride says </s>
<s> so designs now are influenced by the tastes of that mature adult market with shirts often having a nostalgic angle </s>
<s> stride argues this has led to flashy intricate designs becoming less common due to the preferences of the adult market but also because these plain designs are also less likely to clash with the many logos and sponsorship brands the shirts now carry </s>
<s> the innovation in football shirts has shifted from design to marketing tactics says stride </s>
<s> though most clubs now change their home shirt design every season changes often consist of just minor details small flashes collar styles or trim </s>
<s> it is hardly surprising that football shirt design has become so driven by marketing and sponsorship </s>
<s> football clubs have three key revenue streams matchday earnings media and commercial sales where shirt revenue is often the biggest component </s>
<s>  the 20 clubs in the english premier league smashed their record for combined shirt sponsorship deals for the 201718 season by generating 281 </s>
<s> 8 million according to sporting intelligence data an increase of more than 55 million on the previous year </s>
<s> but who is raking in this all cash </s>
<s> the reality is that while fans may like to moan about the clubs a very small group of manufacturers actually take the biggest slice of the replica kit earnings in the uk </s>
<s> these are nike adidas puma and to a far lesser extent smaller kit suppliers like new balance </s>
<s> on average nike earns more in three months than every premier league club combined will earn next season says sports lawyer jake cohen </s>
<s> typically around 5 </s>
<s> 8 of the cost of a 60 replica shirt is the cost of the fabric sewing and shipping according to rohlmann </s>
<s> about 11 </s>
<s> 5 of the sale price is profit for the manufacturer while the club receives just 3 </s>
<s> 6 of the sale price as its licensing fee </s>
<s> retailers take a considerable chunk of the pie with 22 of the shirt price accounting for their profit </s>
<s> the rest of the price is gobbled up by vat distribution and marketing costs he says </s>
<s> but while clubs may be taking a smaller cut than most people might think how do the fans themselves feel about the rising costs </s>
<s> the sale of replica kits is important to the clubs as a way of establishing a link with fans that can last through the ages </s>
<s> ive got a fiveyearold son explains darren bernstein lecturer in football business and marketing for the university campus of football business ucfb based at manchester and wembley </s>
<s> we always say football is generational and you pass your club on to the next generation </s>
<s> im a fan of lower league bury and i want my son to be a fan too the shirt is part of that process of passing down </s>
<s> im quite happy to invest in that in order to pass the baton on and that baton just happens to be a shirt </s>
<s> maybe this explains why theres no real public outcry over the rising costs of replica shirts </s>
<s> the football supporters federation says it does not receive many complaints about the cost of replica kits </s>
<s> many fans do feel kits are expensive and changed too often although theyre not necessarily essential items like match tickets explains an fsf spokesperson </s>
<s> a fair solution might be for manufacturers and clubs to incorporate a sell by date into the kits label </s>
<s> this is something raith rovers already do </s>
<s> the fsf represents supporters in england and wales fans who are able to go to games far more frequently than the millions of overseas devotees who follow the premier league </s>
<s> simon mitton a colleague of bernsteins at ucfb suggests there are other factors involved in selling shirts overseas </s>
<s> lets take tottenham as an example trying to build a relationship in southeast asia with a 13 or 14yearold kid in thailand says mitton who is a senior lecturer in football business and programme development lead at the ucfb </s>
<s> that kids first connection apart from watching tottenham on tv and checking out what the club is doing on the social media platforms is getting the brand new tottenham shirt delivered to him in thailand </s>
<s> another trend is for fans to buy the shirt bearing the name of a particular player </s>
<s> for some supporters it is the status of these superstars that is more important than the club on the front of the shirt </s>
<s> for example they might buy a cristiano ronaldo real madrid shirt a cristiano ronaldo portugal shirt and maybe even a cristiano ronaldo sporting lisbon shirt says mitton </s>
<s> theyll actually purchase shirts around that player icon they follow </s>
<s> but with millions of football shirts being sold worldwide is it really possible for a star player earn back their transfer fee in shirt sales alone </s>
<s> it appears this is a myth </s>
<s> an individual star players transfer fee will never be paid for by their shirt sales alone says sports lawyer jake cohen </s>
<s> he argues that if you imagine a colombian star player is bought by a premier league club colombian football fans are a particularly committed fanbase who very actively buy shirts so their buying could represent say 23m in shirt sales </s>
<s> but this is just a slight shift in overall sales and isnt going to come close to meeting the 10 million and upwards transfer cost </s>
<s> but an elite players association with a manufacturer can be an important factor when it comes to the transfer market </s>
<s> dynamic welsh playmaker gareth bale cost a thenworld record 86 million when he joined real madrid from tottenham in 2013 but he has been in and out of the team this season leading to reports that he may be on the move </s>
<s> according to mitton there are only three possible places he could go  bayern munich juventus or manchester united </s>
<s> the reason for that is they all have adidasproduced shirts and bale is an adidas athlete he explains </s>
<s> if you are a brand that buys a relationship with a club youve also got to have that player iconography underneath to support the drive of the buying function </s>
<s> for those fans struggling to keep up with the everchanging football shirts and the names of the players on the back peter rohlmann believes there could be some good news on the horizon </s>
<s> with the two biggest brands  adidas and nike  only able to focus on supplying kits for a few very lucrative clubs it is giving other smaller manufacturers like puma umbro and new balance the opportunity to partner with other large and attractive clubs </s>
<s> this might be a chance for kits with prices that are not as high as those of adidas and nike he predicts </s>
<s> this extra competition might mean that the average kit prices do not increase as much or at all in the future </s>
<s> none of the 20 premier league clubs we approached for comment on shirt sales were available to comment on this story </s>

<s> i asked myself how did such a substantial fruit  and one i would soon find with an intriguing pedigree  stay under my radar for so long </s>
<s> nearly two decades after cooks original expedition king george iii appointed lieutenant william bligh to lead the breadfruit expedition to tahiti </s>
<s> on 28 november 1787 bligh set sail with his crew aboard the hms bounty </s>
<s> their journey was rough from the start </s>
<s> high winds and stormy weather significantly slowed their voyage and once they reached tahiti bligh and his crew had to wait another five months for the plants to be ready to transport </s>
<s> by the time they set sail for caribbean waters blighs men had grown used to island living  and to the tahitian women </s>
<s> so on 29 april 1789 just a month into their voyage across the south pacific towards the west indies masters mate fletcher christian and 18 other disaffected crew members forced bligh with 18 of his supporters into a 7m longboat and dispatched them into the open waters tossing all the breadfruit plants overboard and sailing off on their own </s>
<s> the mutiny on the bounty is now the stuff of legends and most historians believe that it happened because those siding with christian thought he could help them return to tahiti  something that although eventually did happen didnt quite go as planned </s>
<s> bligh and his crew surprisingly survived making their way by instinct and memory a total of 3618 nautical miles 6701km over 48 days to timor an island in maritime southeast asia </s>
<s> bligh soon returned to england where he was honourably acquitted of any misconduct and two years later set out once again for tahiti this time successfully completing his mission </s>

<s> on the final day of my trip i found myself at papeete market a massive buzzing marketplace just a few blocks from the bay in tahiti </s>
<s> while other travellers perused the countless stalls selling colourfully printed pareos a type of sarong bottles of monoï a mix of coconut oil and flowers and vanilla oils and fragrant gardenia hair adornments i headed upstairs to cafe maeva to try the one breadfruit dish that had eluded me so far frites de uru or deepfried thickcut breadfruit chips </s>

<s> doley tall and broadshouldered head shaved tells me the cal bikal snake is particularly dangerous </s>
<s> to cure its bite doley rinses his mouth with local rice beer an antiseptic of sorts ties a tourniquet above the wound and then puts his mouth to it </s>
<s> i suck the poison away spit it out he says </s>
<s> next he applies a herb paste </s>

<s> afterwards healthy blood will recirculate he says </s>
<s> doley learned these skills not to be attempted at home as a youngster from visiting fishermen </s>

<s> the brahmaputra lives in their rituals and religions nourishes the soil and sustains them far away from the everdeveloping assamese mainland </s>
<s> but it also has the power to destroy and to displace </s>
<s> thanks to climate change the threat of floods erosions and even earthquakes still looms  and is getting more acute </s>
<s> that makes the sapori people who have dwelled here for hundreds of years at risk of losing their homes livelihoods and their lives </s>
<s> im here to understand what lies ahead for the sapori people </s>
<s> to do that i need to begin with the river </s>
<s> dense fog delayed our departure from nimati ghat riverbank that morning but as the view cleared the brahmaputra seemed impossibly calm </s>

<s> add to this heavy rainfall its valley receives over 100 inches annually and inevitable monsoon floods and landslides and it brings families perched precariously on roofs livestock and crops destroyed relief camps crowded </s>
<s> there have been 25 major floods since 1950 </s>
<s> across india more than 11000 people died in 1977 alone </s>
<s> in july 2012 two million were left homeless only for more floods to follow that september when another 1 </s>

<s> the sapori people suffer most as vulnerable as the islands themselves </s>
<s> one innovation to help them is the boat clinic which i am travelling with for the week </s>
<s> after one of these floods journalist sanjoy hazarika heard the story of a pregnant young sapori woman who died before reaching a mainland hospital </s>
<s> and so began his idea for the brahmaputra boat clinic a mobile medical unit that can reach the islanders not only in emergencies but to provide the kind of basic routine care like immunisations that the sapori people disconnected from the mainlands infrastructure usually have lacked </s>
<s> hazarika who is also a researcher policy analyst and filmmaker began in 2005 with one boat and a world bank award of 20000 </s>

<s> the 1950 independence day earthquake 8 </s>
<s> 6 on the richter scale killed around 1000 people and changed the brahmaputras course forever </s>

<s> since the earthquake the river bed has risen by up to 10 metres and continues to widen </s>
<s> silt leaves the land fertile but now the river has become braided  one channel turns into many the water eroding the river banks as it goes </s>
<s> between 1954 and 2008 the total area of erosion in this region was 427000 hectares 4 of the plains of assam </s>
<s> since the earthquake erosion has decimated more than 2500 villages 18 towns countless cultural heritage sites and entire tea gardens </s>
<s> nearly half a million people have been affected </s>
<s> between 2005 and 2010 alone 880 villages and almost 37000 houses were completely eroded </s>
<s> even the school on doleys island tumbled into the water earlier this year </s>
<s> other dangers loom including plans for dams that potentially could divert the brahmaputras course </s>
<s> rising temperatures are shrinking the glaciers of the himalayas and the tibetan plateau accelerated by air pollution which could cause more flooding </s>
<s> in some places the state governments plan on climate change predicts a 25 increase in flooding and 75 in droughts along with additional erosion mudflows and avalanches predicted </s>

<s> suddenly there is a cry from payeng xihu xihu </s>
<s>  dolphin dolphin </s>
<s> a ganges river dolphin leaps through the air </s>
<s> we are fortunate to catch this glimpse </s>
<s> the dolphin is officially endangered facing threats across the ganges and brahmaputra pollution entanglement in fishing nets dams that split up populations and reduce prey and harvesting for dolphin oil </s>
<s> conservation projects are encouraging fishermen to use alternative baits but only 1200 of these river dolphins remain throughout india less than 300 in the brahmaputra </s>
<s> our sighting gives some hope though </s>
<s> the dolphin sits at the apex of the aquatic food chain and so its very presence signals a healthy ecosystem and biodiversity </s>
<s> but there is little room for complacency </s>
<s> the yangtze river dolphin was declared functionally extinct in 2006 solely due to the actions of humans including overfishing dambuilding and ship collisions </s>
<s> the ganges river dolphin also remains vulnerable </s>
<s> over the following few days we travel to more sandbanks clambering over rotting logs and parched earth </s>
<s> dust swirls </s>
<s> we visit other mishing tribes and sometimes other groups too deoris boros rabhas lalung  there are more than 220 ethnic groups in the brahmaputra valley with at least 45 languages and many more religions laws and customs </s>
<s> the younger generation occasionally seek work on the mainland usually in the service industry but the agricultural sector remains the mainstay of employment </s>
<s> and so as long as the land is endangered its people are too their fates entwined </s>
<s> they speak of erosion time and time again </s>
<s> we must fight it says payeng </s>
<s> otherwise the saporis will wash away </s>
<s> this is a land war </s>
<s> that war is complex </s>
<s> embankments constructed against floods actually could worsen erosion  whether by confining the rivers course increasing the waters velocity or simply shifting problems from one area to another </s>
<s> dredging is another proposal the latter is claimed to battle erosion through increasing the rivers watercarrying capacity but could equally change the rivers course and faces enormous technical challenges </s>
<s> costly geotextile tubes used to stabilise a river bank at majuli were washed away within a year </s>
<s> stone spurs divert strong currents thus protecting one location but potentially triggering erosion downstream </s>
<s> boulders and sand bags protect receding river banks but are hardly infallible </s>
<s> antierosion efforts need to address other factors too  especially deforestation dams and climate change </s>
<s> hazarika is struck that those championing various antierosion strategies rarely ask the people living on the islands and river banks for their opinions </s>
<s> its not just about people of course he says </s>
<s> we must be mindful of one simple issue we are only one of the many species living in these ecosystems privileged to share space with them </s>
<s> payeng later tells me of a mishing folk story patukari tuyub the dolphin maiden </s>
<s> one version has a young girl yakasi being drowned by her neighbours dressed in black a wooden pestle attached to her back two brooms tied to her hands she is pushed into the river </s>
<s> she returns as a dolphin the story goes those brooms became her fins </s>
<s> and so the mishing see the river dolphin as their longlost daughter to be revered and protected at all costs </s>
<s> as we watch another dolphin somersault alongside the boat yakasi is still with us </s>
<s> but her future and the future of her people depends on decisions made on the mainland </s>
<s> onto to the next sapori we go </s>
<s> we have no map to guide us but payeng will surely get us there </s>

<s> small details that bypass the intellect offering a different way into a subject widely covered by historians </s>
<s> my access to this subject was on the emotional side not through history or statistics  the numbers and what they did and how they did it which we all grew up with and know helwig tells bbc culture </s>
<s> the problem with that is the perpetrators are always the others  were trying to establish that this happened in most german families and how can that happen </s>
<s>  one of her subjects has had to confront that more than most </s>
<s> born in 1939 niklas frank is the son of hans frank the nazi governor of poland and he travelled through europe with the human rights lawyer philippe sands in the acclaimed documentary my nazi legacy what our fathers did </s>
<s> his memory in kriegskinder is from a childhood shopping trip with his mother and nanny </s>
<s> we are driving through the krakow ghetto where my mother buys her furs and scarfs for a price of her own choosing </s>
<s> i am standing in the back of the mercedes my nanny hilde sitting next to me in front next to the driver my mother he recalls </s>

<s> i stick out my tongue to an older boy </s>
<s> he turns around walks off i feel like i won </s>
<s> i laugh triumphantly but hilde pulls me silently back into my seat </s>
<s> although it describes a juvenile encounter its a disturbing memory </s>
<s> most of the firsthand accounts in the book are quite anecdotal says helwig </s>
<s> what they say is interesting  but also what they dont say </s>
<s> many describe death in the only way they could comprehend it as children </s>
<s> one day a hanged man is lying in front of our house in berlin </s>
<s> a german </s>
<s> he had tried to hide from the war in a ruined building and they hung him from the crossbar of the lamp post says werner </s>
<s> when he was dead they cut him loose </s>
<s> he lies there for days with his mouth open and we children throw pebble stones into it </s>
<s> eventually they take him away and bury him on the side of the road </s>
<s> because no dead bodies can lie in the city streets trucks arrive dig him and others up and throw them onto the trucks </s>

<s> replayed through their senses remembered via taste or sound or smell the memories of the kriegskinder bring past events into the present </s>
<s> to this day many remember the air raid shelters the bombing raids the fear of the adults around them the dead and wounded the hanged and the suicides the bombed houses and playing in the rubble writes alexandra senfft  the granddaughter of a nazi war criminal and author of the long shadow of the past descendants face their nazi family history  in the foreword for kriegskinder </s>
<s> clear or hazy many have images of flightand of the russians they still feel the hunger and taste the chocolate given to them by american soldiers </s>
<s> to read these memories is to be brought closer to a place of understanding by seeing them as children even as we look at them as old people we acknowledge the ambiguities of who they are </s>
<s> to recognize perpetrators in ones father or mother and to reconcile this recognition with ones love towards them is an act full of ambivalence and unbearable tensions writes senfft </s>
<s> often the concealed crime weighs so heavily on the descendants psyche that they can hardly process it how can a beloved and loving father have been a murderer at the same time </s>
<s> a minority manage to differentiate between the perpetrator and the loved parent and to integrate both to let each stand alongside the other </s>
<s> yet the majority either deny the misdeed or break with their parent </s>
<s> although a generation has passed since the war what took place lives on in family dynamics </s>
<s> what the kriegskinder did not come to terms with they passed onto us grandchildren writes senfft </s>
<s> psychologists have found that many grandchildren internalized their grandparents experience even if the nazi era was never spoken of </s>
<s> grandchildren thus often possess the family memory without having experienced the events themselves </s>
<s> helwig found this when she had children herself </s>
<s> it took me becoming a parent to actually be able to really empathise with my parents having witnessed world war two at the ages of five and six she says </s>
<s> the idea for this book came when i was talking to my friends asking them how are we going to teach our children about this history and how do we keep them interested in it  or how do we teach them the responsibility which comes with it </s>
<s> through those conversations with my peers came also the realisation that our parents were probably a little bit odd at times and they have these behavioural patterns which show us that they grew up during the war </s>
<s> it opened up a whole dialogue between us </s>
<s> this was her real aim  initiating a conversation </s>
<s> every german knows about the holocaust were educated with it its been documented at large but what hasnt really been talked about in german families is what did the greatgrandfather do or what exactly happened  there still seems to be a taboo there </s>
<s> that isnt necessarily because the kriegskinder want to remain silent </s>
<s> that generation is now at a time where theyve carried all this for a long time and a lot of the people we interviewed were actually quite open about it but said that many people were not really interested in what they had to say </s>
<s> helwig hopes that by bringing together recollections from childhoods in nazi germany with portraits of a generation whose memories will soon vanish her book can help change that </s>
<s> theres an emotional process happening and through that emotional process hopefully it creates a curiosity to ask more questions and to have frank conversations to be able to access that time she says </s>
<s> its not about victimising this generation its important to try and encourage the generations to start talking to each other </s>
<s> the book ends with a quote from israeli psychologist dan baron violent conflicts create zones of silence in a society </s>
<s> the deeds and responsibility of the perpetrators are concealed </s>
<s> thus also the suffering of the victims the role of the spectators </s>
<s> the silence is often passed on to the next generation </s>
<s> kriegskinder is published in a climate that gives a renewed urgency to these conversations </s>
<s> the book wants to raise a certain awareness that yes it was a long time ago but that doesnt mean it couldnt happen again says helwig </s>
<s> when we started this project in 2014 we lived in a very different world from today </s>
<s> i told friends in germany that i was doing this book about the kriegskinder and the response was oh interesting but do we need to talk about that still </s>
<s> look at germany today  it was at the height of merkel and obama  and suddenly two years later germany and europe and america are faced with very different scenarios </s>
<s> in her foreword senfft acknowledges how collective silence can infect wider groups </s>
<s> research  has shown that trauma and severe stress can be hereditary that which is not dealt with can be passed on to the next generation </s>
<s> and it leaches out beyond the family </s>
<s> what is not brought to light and engaged with individually and within the family finds its way into society and politics </s>

<s> up close though we lose any sense of the photographs underlying structure and become involved instead in the individual human dramas and signs of life being played out in each flat </s>

<s> hese were exciting images that seemed not only to document our world but also to interpret it </s>
<s> thanks in large part to the efforts of gursky and his fellow german photographers few people today would question the mediums legitimacy as contemporary art </s>
<s> together the photographers at the heart of this movement who also include the artists candida höfer and jörg sasse are known as the düsseldorf school because that is where they studied during the 70s and 80s </s>
<s> in fact according to martin engler who has curated the exhibition at the städel their education at düsseldorfs famous arts academy where joseph beuys was appointed professor of sculpture in 1961 is one of the key things that links this group of eight or nine artists because in other respects they are remarkably diverse </s>
<s> at the heart of englers exhibition is the following question how important as an influence upon this special generation were their teachers in düsseldorf the german photographers bernd and hilla becher </s>
<s> the answer it transpires is extremely important </s>
<s> if you arent already familiar with the bechers then its time to become acquainted with two crucial figures in the history of photography </s>
<s> draconian and dispassionate  it was 1976 when bernd becher 19312007 who had trained as a painter was appointed professor of photography at the academy of art in düsseldorf </s>
<s> his wife and artistic partner hilla 19342015 was never given a formal role at the institution but she always worked closely with her husband who often taught at home and was an equally important influence upon his students until 1996 when bernd left the faculty </s>
<s> they had met as students themselves at düsseldorfs kunstakademie in 1957 and began collaborating two years later before getting married in 1961 </s>
<s> during the 60s they spent time in new york city where they encountered avantgarde art and mixed with conceptual and minimalist artists such as carl andre </s>
<s> their experience in new york totally changed the way they perceived photography engler says </s>
<s> upon their return they started to present their work not as single images but rather as series arranged in grids of nine 12 or 15 photographs  a bit like a carl andre floor piece explains engler </s>
<s> typically their subject matter was the disappearing architecture of heavy industry  blast furnaces water towers coal bunkers gas coolers lime kilns storage silos factories warehouses and the like </s>
<s> to begin with they were interested in old industrial plants that werent being used anymore  it was clear already that these structures belonged to an industrial history that was becoming lost engler says </s>
<s> following their american experience though this nostalgic idea of preserving memories changed totally </s>
<s> in 1990 the bechers received a prestigious award at the venice biennale not for photography but for sculpture  the bechers started presenting their industrial photographs according to type  and consequently referred to each grid of images as a typology </s>
<s> one such typology consisting of a grid of photographs of nine different water towers executed around 1980 was sold earlier this year at an auction in new york for 75000 58000 </s>
<s> the work is called simply water towers </s>
<s> subject matter and mode of presentation arent the only distinctive things about the bechers photographs a draconian dispassionate style is a hallmark of their work too </s>
<s> influenced by the socalled neue sachlichkeit new objectivity photography of germans august sander and karl blossfeldt they always documented their subjects in a scrupulously objective fashion shooting from the same height and at the same time of day and ensuring that nothing but milky opaque grey sky was visible in the background </s>
<s> they also believed that fineart photography had to be blackandwhite </s>
<s> their style is very reduced very strict engler says </s>
<s> you could call it austere </s>
<s> the bechers saw themselves as conceptual artists first and foremost rather than photographers the title of their first photography book published in 1970 was anonymous sculptures </s>
<s> controversially in 1990 they received a prestigious award at the venice biennale not for photography but for sculpture </s>
<s> the funny thing is says engler that they never did anything else apart from their typologies </s>
<s> when bernd died hilla continued their work  not making photographs anymore but rearranging and making new typologies from material that they had shot together over the previous 40 years </s>
<s> the bechers changed our idea of what the photographic image could be  martin engler  the bechers changed our idea of what the photographic image could be engler explains </s>
<s> they tried to give an idea of the complexity of their time by showing that perception isnt based on one image but always on a series of images </s>
<s> this was very influential </s>
<s> on a simple level a becher typology while made up of individually small photographs occupies a lot of wall space  and scale is of course something to which gursky and his peers were drawn </s>
<s> the big portraits of thomas ruff say which are 2m x 1 </s>
<s> 5m have the same format as the typologies of the bechers engler points out </s>
<s> they really compete with painting </s>
<s> moreover the severe unsentimental objectivity of the bechers work influenced the understated tone and atmosphere of the output of the düsseldorf school </s>
<s> their photographs are rarely intense or passionate  they dont depict highly emotional scenes such as car crashes says engler </s>
<s> rather they are often melancholy alienated and in many cases literally devoid of people just like the bechers work </s>
<s> engler gestures to paris montparnasse to illustrate the bechers influence </s>
<s> in a way this image is very like a becher typology he says </s>
<s> its an austere building depicted in a strict and unemotional way </s>
<s> and of course we can never quite perceive the whole thing </s>
<s> you must go close to understand whats inside these little apartments which all look the same </s>
<s> but you also have this movement backing off from the artwork to understand the totality </s>
<s> even ruffs famous series of large portraits of people exhibits becherlike tendencies aside from scale </s>
<s> ruff photographed all his friends at the academy in düsseldorf engler says </s>
<s> traditionally the idea of portraiture was to give psychological insight into a person </s>
<s> what ruff was saying with these largerthanlife portraits was that the closer you get the less you know a person </s>
<s> in a way they too become like the façade of a building </s>
<s> he points at one of ruffs portraits of a famous artist from georgia </s>
<s> you can see her huge eyes even little wrinkles </s>

<s> i have proven myself to be a trustworthy person among their community </s>
<s> for many hijras that community has come to replace their family  and it has a defined group structure </s>
<s> hijras have developed a culture where they live under a guru who provides them with social safety shelter and basic necessities in exchange for money and in some cases recognition says sharmin </s>
<s> they start to nurture a family with a leader almost like a sorority house </s>
<s> their daily earnings are all collected by the guru who then provides them with their necessities and the rest is saved for future investment including safety event planning travel and in some cases they fund and help for sex changes </s>
<s> the gurus take on a significant role in the lives of hijras </s>
<s> they are almost like guardians to them taking the place of their parents </s>

<s> different gurus have different expectations or rules </s>
<s> in most cases they are subjected to very strict rules </s>
<s> they must earn a certain amount or provide a particular service to be deemed capable </s>
<s> while joining a hijra group offers stability choosing their new identity means making themselves vulnerable in a society that increasingly sees them as outcasts </s>
<s> transcending the biological definition hijras are more of social phenomena as a minority group and have a longrecorded history in south asia says sharmin </s>
<s> she notes that traditionally hijras held semisacred status and were hired to sing dance and bless newly married couples or newborns at household parties </s>
<s> they used to earn their living based on the cultural belief that hijras can bless ones house with prosperity and fertility </s>
<s> yet that has changed over time and hijras have lost their admired space in society outside the group they are discriminated against and scorned almost everywhere </s>
<s> now they make a living by walking around the streets collecting money from shopkeepers bus and train passengers or by prostitution </s>
<s> many hijras in bangladesh choose to migrate to india where they are more accepted </s>
<s> growing up in a conservative family this wasnt something we talked about at the dinner table says sharmin </s>
<s> there has always been a strong prejudice and a stigma about hijras </s>
<s> there seemed to be a negative connotation to the word hijra </s>
<s> i grew up knowing that hijras were social outcasts </s>
<s> i like almost everyone else in my society grew up seeing them as less than human says sharmin </s>

<s> she opened her life to me made me a part of her world and helped me to see something beyond the word hijra </s>
<s> call me heena was her response to that and she says that she hoped to photograph in a way which represents them as individuals without the obvious superficial biases </s>
<s> meiselas praised sharmin for her treatment of those she photographed saying that her project brings us closer to a highly stigmatised minority she honours their distinctive qualities by portraying a quiet pride in their uniqueness </s>
<s> i have never really physically experienced how it feels to be a part of an actual minority group says sharmin </s>
<s> i grew up in bangladesh as a woman </s>
<s> sure there are limitations and restrictions but what real struggle can be when the question of identity and emotions comes into the picture is something i had wondered about </s>
<s> photographing the hijras has broken many of sharmins own biases </s>

<s> in 2014 the supreme court of india ruled that hijras would be recognised on official documents under a separate third gender category allowing them access to government jobs and college places </s>

<s> the photographer is now embarking on his most ambitious and direct exploration of immigration yet a sprawling series titled the new british family comprising shots of families across london who hail from other countries  indeed every other country </s>
<s> so far he has photographed immigrants from 66 nations including kyrgyzstan and the democratic republic of congo south korea and syria </s>
<s> that leaves 140 countries still to go </s>
<s> the most significant change taking place in britain right now is immigration steeleperkins says </s>
<s> and that represents a seismic shift in what it means to be british </s>
<s> i want to make a record an ethnographic statement of britains new reality </s>
<s> through the relatively simple photographic exercise of group portraiture steeleperkins reveals how complex and interwoven our ideals of nationhood and ethnicity have become  and how enduring nevertheless the family structure remains </s>
<s> when he began steeleperkins thought hed mainly find families of single nationalities </s>
<s> he quickly learned that was naïve todays families cross numerous ethnic and national borders </s>
<s> through his photographs viewers meet one nuclear family whose members hold kyrgyzstan jamaican and british passports the members of another include mexican south korean and us citizens </s>
<s> there exists in britain this strange alchemy that is somehow rather successful at integrating people at making them feel they can constructively be part of this society he says </s>
<s> as well as british identity the project also explores what it means to be a londoner  originally the project was even called the new londoners </s>
<s> for steeleperkins and many of his subjects the capital and the nation are indivisible even as london continues to develop its own distinct sense of self </s>
<s> one of the things that struck me is how often i met people who didnt regard themselves as british but as londoners he says </s>
<s> theres a very distinct london identity now </s>
<s> its becoming more difficult i think for people to be able to legitimately claim to be british or hungarian or jewish or black  but they can be londoners </s>
<s> there is also a personal element to this project </s>
<s> steeleperkins was brought to england by his father so that he could attend christs hospital boarding school his mother remained in burma </s>
<s> living in burnhamonsea on the somerset coast steeleperkins understood from a young age that nobody else in that community looked quite like him </s>
<s> from pretty early on i was acutely aware of being not quite the same he says </s>
<s> his experience has made him particularly aware of the way in which immigration is discussed in the uk </s>
<s> immigration has been treated in the media sensationally he says </s>
<s> weve seen a lot of ethnic groups being targeted and then rather excessively worried about are they going to blow us up </s>
<s> are they going to riot in the streets </s>
<s>  as an immigrant myself it felt insane that people took that kind of view </s>
<s> that isnt to say steeleperkins always took an openminded view of immigration or even of other peoples ethnicity </s>
<s> i was loaded up by a bunch of different prejudices he says of his early years as a photographer a career he pursued after stints as a chemistry and psychology student </s>
<s> i had a lot of opinions that were less than tasteful </s>
<s> people are brought up with prejudice and you are only able to dismiss it with experience  by meeting people and talking to them rather than reading about them or listening to other peoples stories about them </s>
<s> photography has allowed me to do that </s>
<s> and of course to communicate those ideas to others  as with the new british family which shows viewers a vast and complex of array of different experiences of british living </s>

<s> fashion photography has changed </s>
<s> worldfamous imagemaker nick knight is telling me how smartphones and advances in imageediting apps are fundamentally altering his line of work perhaps even rendering traditional fashion photography obsolete </s>
<s> technological advances are opening up image capture and manipulation to a wider audience enabling big budget effects on everyday devices while behind the scenes the power balance between model and magazine is shifting </s>
<s> knight makes a case for photography  as we understand it  being over </s>
<s> his point is that it used to be relatively straightforward </s>
<s> the imagemaking i do now is no longer defined by any of those parameters he says ive argued strongly for the last ten years or more that we have to say photography is finished  it isnt the medium we use anymore </s>
<s> of course photography still exists but for knight its no longer the medium we turn to when we want to communicate visually </s>
<s> theres a new medium called imagemaking which behaves in a completely different way is done by completely different equipment and is expressed in completely different chemicals and minerals </s>
<s> hes referring to devices like smartphones and applications like instagram which allow for nearinstant image editing and can be shared immediately with a massive global audience </s>
<s> accessible yet still magical is how justin cooke describes instagram and the work which appears on it </s>
<s> cooke is now ceo of the agency innovate7 but used to work as vice president of pr at burberry </s>
<s> he was part of a team who met with kevin systrom cofounder of instagram </s>
<s> adoption of the app by burberry while instagram was still upandcoming was vital in keeping the brand ahead of the competition according to cooke </s>
<s> instagram was one of those apps that come up every so often like twitter or glitché or mega photo that allows you to do at the click of a button what before would have taken a long time says knight </s>
<s> i like it because im not someone whose primary way of expressing themself is through writing </s>
<s> back to the future  the imagery knight now creates is often shot directly on his iphone and then run through a selection of imageediting apps  the aforementioned mega photo and glitché being favourites  or traditional photoshop as with his beautiful images seen in the catalogue of somerset house in londons exhibtion isabella blow fashion galore </s>
<s> knights images are then uploaded to his instagram account </s>
<s> it took me back in a weird way to the beginnings of my love of photography in the 1970s </s>
<s> i could create something from the world around me but of course you have to go through the whole process of having the film developed printing it in the darkroom and finding somewhere to show it </s>
<s> that bit has been superaccelerated </s>
<s> this acceleration suits the internet well </s>
<s> as knight points out most people get their style information online now and that makes it the most appropriate medium for publishing fashion images  far more so than traditional magazines </s>
<s> clothes are ultimately designed with movement in mind  and the possibilities of imagemaking  and video stretch beyond those offered in print </s>
<s> out of print </s>
<s> the changing nature of fashion photography and photography in general will affect traditional practitioners and has unsurprisingly been met with resistance from some </s>
<s> theres a certain amount of very understandable reluctance says knight </s>
<s> where there is a sense of fear is from people who are going to be put out of work by it or who are going to have to change their way of thinking  magazine promoters for example whose job it is to lionise print </s>
<s> models however stand to benefit greatly from the changes </s>
<s> traditionally models have been beholden to magazines for work and for exposure but at this point cara delevingne has over three million followers on her instagram account kim kardashian has eleven million </s>
<s> i dont think its sunk in to the models yet but they have the balance of power now says knight </s>
<s> that power shift is something thats fundamental and will change how we perceive people and how the whole system operates </s>
<s> once the power shift is understood the models will likely have a very different relationship with the fashion publications that sell perhaps a couple of hundred thousand copies </s>
<s> the models can say wait a minute by a factor of a hundred you should be working for me </s>
<s> so it changes things a lot </s>
<s> what are the limitations of smartphone photography </s>
<s> as an enthusiast and an earlier adopter knight has had time to critically assess the options available through the app store and elsewhere </s>
<s> i ask what in an ideal world he would like to add to his current smartphone toolkit </s>
<s> the answer surprisingly goes back to traditional photography </s>
<s> the default on smartphones is a wide angle lens  thats fine for certain sorts of photography or certain sorts of image making </s>
<s> you can see why people did it i want to take a picture of my friend sitting in the car seat opposite me and if ive got a wideangle lens i can get most of my friend in </s>
<s> but its not ideal for all situations and can also create distortions </s>
<s> knights observation highlights just how young this medium is </s>
<s> there is a plentiful supply of apps designed to paper over the limitations of smartphone cameras and even more which achieve effects and circulation boosts either impossible or hugely time consuming with traditional cameras </s>
<s> but there are also technical developments needed  for example in the realms of lensmaking  before the full extent of the repercussions on traditional fashion photography can be known </s>
<s> love is a paradox </s>
<s> its force argues the philosopher michael hardt derives from contradiction </s>
<s> on the one hand love is an attachment the strongest and most unshakeable relationship you can have with another person </s>
<s> on the other love is an explosion  an event that marks you for life an irrevocable division between then and now </s>
<s> love for all its mystery has of course been one of the great subjects of western art and its many varieties  courtly love erotic love filial love divine love  have been depicted through grecoroman allegory romantic iconography or harsh realism </s>
<s> until recently that is </s>
<s> love is still the principle obsession of songwriters and filmmakers but among artists love went somewhat out of fashion in the central decades of the 20th century </s>
<s> until recently artists have seemed more comfortable investigating sex and the social and political dimensions of the body than the disruptive unpredictable phenomenon of love </s>
<s> yet today love is back on view in the galleries and often in disarmingly candid guises </s>
<s> great art about love in all its messiness and splendour requires an artist who is willing to be vulnerable and to risk embarrassment  an artist like sophie calle </s>

<s> his untitled perfect lovers from 1991 consists of two batteryoperated clocks that hang side by side ticking away in sync </s>
<s> the ticking suggests an eternal perpetual love that will go on long after the beholder leaves the gallery </s>

<s> but the desire for chefs to declare themselves artists  more precisely to brand their cooking not just artistic but actually art itself  is a newer thing </s>
<s> earlier chefs such as françois vatel or auguste escoffier might have called themselves artists but its important to unpack that term it was used as a means to analogise their work to painting and sculpture not as a claim that no distinction existed </s>

<s> pleasure rather than insight or antagonism is all we ask </s>
<s> when a chef like adrià is acclaimed as an artist or when organic obsessives wax rhapsodic about the cultural virtues of turnips it says we expect less from art than we used to and food can do the rather small job as well if not better than a picture in a white cube </s>

<s> andreas gursky was born in 1955 in leipzig came to west germany as a child and rose to prominence as a photographer in the late 1980s and early 1990s  not it must be said on his own </s>
<s> he emerged alongside a pair of other young photographers thomas struth and thomas ruff who had studied alongside gursky at the kunstakademie düsseldorf </s>
<s> it was and is an august art school where joseph beuys gerhard richter and sigmar polke had taught or studied in decades past </s>
<s> when gursky arrived and photography department was led by the married artists bernd and hilla becher </s>

<s> large color photographs decorate small blackandwhite photographs dont  susan kismaric  the bechers students formed what became known as the düsseldorf school  each of them applying in their own way the lessons of the bechers </s>
<s> gursky after a series of early landscapes began to depict the nodes and epicenters of the fastchanging global economy whether a prada store a shanghai hotel or a chicago stock exchange all photographed at a chilly becherian remove </s>
<s> struth shot tourists in museums and carefully posed families ruff made clinical portraits </s>
<s> in the late 1990s the three even got the unlovely nickname struffsky a portmanteau of their names that unfairly suggested they were interchangeable </s>
<s> standing at a slight distance was a fourth becher student candida höfer known for her sober images of libraries and opera houses </s>
<s> other students of the bechers achieved less fame but exhibited similar dispassion among them elger esser jörg sasse axel hütte and simone nieweg </s>
<s> gursky and his fellowtravelers came of age at a critical moment in the history of photography for two reasons </s>
<s> first photographys status in the art world was undergoing a critical shift in appraisal when gursky began to exhibit in the late 80s and early 90s </s>
<s> once only partially accepted as an artistic medium it blossomed into a discipline as important and increasingly as expensive as painting or sculpture </s>
<s> second new digital technologies for making editing and printing images were offering photographers entirely new ways to work </s>
<s> gursky even more than struth and ruff began to print his images at gargantuan scale </s>
<s> his 1999 panorama of the rhine at 4 </s>
<s> 3m then 2 </s>
<s> 7m the most expensive photo ever sold at auction measures three and a half meters wide </s>
<s> without doubting gurskys motives we might remember the observation of moma photography curator susan kismaric on why photography got supersized during the last economic boom large color photographs decorate small blackandwhite photographs dont decorate </s>
<s>   he also began to employ digital manipulation first sparingly then wildly </s>
<s> gursky embraced digital manipulation early in his 1993 photograph of pariss giant mouchotte tower block multiple images are grafted together in postproduction to produce a single overwhelming panorama </s>
<s> ruff went digital too with calamitous results  see or rather dont his woozy manipulation of porn images  whereas höfer and struth continue to eschew digital trickery </s>
<s>  soon he was lost in it and eschewing the camera for the computer </s>
<s> his 2001 stockholder meeting was fashioned from dozens of standalone images and recent google earthstyle epics are fashioned out of satellite imagery </s>
<s> he has kept it up </s>
<s> at his retrospective in badenbaden gursky is displaying a headscratching new photograph in which we see barnett newmans 195051 painting vir heroicus sublimis in front of which sit germanys four living chancellors a pomaded gerhard schröder roundshouldered helmut kohl canaryclad angela merkel and even 96yearold helmut schmidt with his ubiquitous cigarette </s>

<s>  it was a prescient question </s>
<s> and i suspect we can answer it with no  at least if the work of younger artists and curators is any guide </s>
<s> social media has obviated the need for anyone to print an image at all  at the turn of the millennium photographys future seemed to be one of higher and higher resolution and more and more exact digital editing tools such that all artists  maybe even all consumers  could aspire to the grandeur of 18thcentury history painting </s>
<s> instead cameras were absorbed into our phones and social media obviated the need for anyone to print an image at all </s>
<s> when was the last time you printed a photograph six years ago </s>
<s>  the importance of photographs today for artists as much as for laypeople derives less from their quality than from their ability to circulate and transmit information and appearances and the kinds of images that do so are diametrically opposed to gurskyian grandeur </s>
<s> in the words of another german artist hito steyerl the image of our time is not the superslick panorama but the poor image uploaded downloaded shared reformatted and reedited </s>
<s> it transforms quality into accessibility </s>
<s> gursky is now 60 </s>
<s> he has earned a degree of deference </s>
<s> one could imagine that a student of the conceptually sophisticated bechers would be thinking about much more than the subject matter of his photography  that he would also care about how viewers see them how they are reproduced how they are transmitted </s>
<s> but unlike other photographers of his generation such jeff wall and cindy sherman gursky has shown no interest over the last decade in rethinking his practice and if anything he has doubled down on opulence and awe </s>
<s> he also relies on heavy doses of copyright protection </s>
<s>  thats especially clear when you look at his recent photographs made from preexisting imagery such as the giant satellite images and the cheesy cynical chancellor portrait </s>
<s> they suggest that unlike some of his düsseldorf colleagues and despite his early gaze on stock markets and sweatshops gursky was never too engaged with the world as it is </s>
